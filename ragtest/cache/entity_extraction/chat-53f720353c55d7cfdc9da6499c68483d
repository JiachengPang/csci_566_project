Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to\nescape the straps holding them inside the box.\n\n\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\nBludgers.\n\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\nHarry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking\nhis nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around\ntheir heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to\npin it to the ground.\n\n\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\nand strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to\nknock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each\nteam -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their\nside from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So\n-- think you've got all that?\"\n\n\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\ngoal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry\nreeled off.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Wood.\n\n\"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he\nsounded offhand.\n\n\"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse\nthan that. Now, the last member of the team is the\n\nSeeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the\nBludgers unless they crack my head open.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I\nmean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"\n\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\nCompared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size\nof a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver\nwings.\n\n\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important\nball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and\ndifficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave\nin and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it\nbefore the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the\nSnitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they\n\nnearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of\nQuidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\n-- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on\nsubstitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that's it -- any\nquestions?\"\n\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\ndoing it that was going to be the problem.\n\n\"We won't practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting\nit back inside the crate, \"it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try\nyou out with a few of these.\"\n\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\nminutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf\nballs as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n\nHarry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an\nhour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.\n\n\"That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily\nas they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn't be surprised if you\nturn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for\nEngland if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons.\"\n\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\nthree evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly\nbelieve it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two\nmonths. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His\nlessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had\nmastered the basics.\n\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin\nwafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced\nin Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,\nsomething they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make\nNeville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the\nclass into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which\nwas a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron,\nhowever, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell\nwhether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to\neither of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.\n\n\"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!\"\nsqueaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as\nusual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic\nwords properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio,\nwho said 's'\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
