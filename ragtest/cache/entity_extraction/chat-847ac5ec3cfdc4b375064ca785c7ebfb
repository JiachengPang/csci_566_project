Hagrid\ncalled \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the door\nquickly behind them.\n\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there\nwas a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them\nstoat sandwiches, which they refused.\n\n\"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \"We were\nwondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone\napart from Fluffy.\"\n\nHagrid frowned at him.\n\n\"0' course I cant, he said. \"Number one, I don' know meself. Number two,\nyeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That\nStone's here fer a good reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I\ns'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou'\nFluffy.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,\nyou know everything that goes on round here,\" said Hermione in a warm,\nflattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was\nsmiling. \"We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\" Hermione\nwent on. \"We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him,\napart from you.\"\n\nHagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at\nHermione.\n\n\"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let's see... he\nborrowed Fluffy from me... then some o' the teachers did enchantments...\nProfessor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --\" he\nticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell -- an' Dumbledore\nhimself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh\nyeah, Professor Snape.\"\n\n\"Snape?\"\n\n\"Yeah -- yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped\nprotect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it.\"\n\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape\nhad been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out\nhow the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything --\nexcept, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy.\n\n\"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren't you,\nHagrid?\" said Harry anxiously. \"And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you?\nNot even one of the teachers?\"\n\n\"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly.\n\n\"Well, that's something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can we\nhave a window open? I'm boiling.\"\n\n\"Can't, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the\nfire. Harry looked at it, too.\n\n\"Hagrid -- what's that?\"\n\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire,\nunderneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That's er...\"\n\n\"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get\na closer look at the egg. \"It must've cost you a fortune.\"\n\n\"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a\nfew drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was\nquite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\"\n\n\"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?\" said Hermione.\n\n\"Well, I've bin doin' some readin' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book\nfrom under his pillow. \"Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding\nfor Pleasure and Profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's\nall in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I\nem, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with\nchicken blood every half hour. An' see here -- how ter recognize\ndiff'rent eggs -- what I got there's a Norwegian Ridgeback. They're\nrare, them.\"\n\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't.\n\n\"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said.\n\nBut Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the\nfire.\n\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to\nHagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\n\"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening\nafter evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were\ngetting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and\nRon, too. It was driving them nuts.\n\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.\nHe had written only two words: It's hatching.\n\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione\nwouldn't hear of it.\n\n\"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\nhatching?\"\n\n\"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what\nHagrid's going to be in when\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
