UP another\nstaircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the\nwork much easier.\n\n\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the\ntallest tower.\n\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.\nForgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the\nshadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each\nother ten feet away. A lamp flared.\n\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by\nthe ear.\n\n\"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering\naround in the middle of the night, how dare you --\"\n\n\"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a\ndragon!\"\n\n\"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see\nProfessor Snape about you, Malfoy!\"\n\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest\nthing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the\ncold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe\nproperly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\n\n\"Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!\"\n\n\"Don't,\" Harry advised her.\n\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his\ncrate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out\nof the darkness.\n\nCharlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the\nharness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.\nThey all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and\nHermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.\n\nAt last, Norbert was going... going... gone.\n\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as\ntheir hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in\ndetention -- what could spoil their happiness?\n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they\nstepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the\ndarkness.\n\n\"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\"\n\nThey'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\nTHE FORIBIDDEN FOREST\n\nThings couldn't have been worse.\n\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor,\nwhere they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione\nwas trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each\nother around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't\nsee how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were\ncornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?\nThere was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for\ntheir being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of\nnight, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was\nout-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility\ncloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\n\nHad Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong.\nWhen Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\n\n\"Harry!\" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was\ntrying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to\ncatch you, he said you had a drag --\"\n\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor\nMcGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert\nas she towered over the three of them.\n\n\"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were\nup in the astronomy tower. It's one o'clock in the morning. Explain\nyourselves.\"\n\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's\nquestion. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\n\n\"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on,\" said Professor\nMcGonagall. \"It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco\nMalfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of\nbed and into trouble. I've already caught him. I suppose you think it's\nfunny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\"\n\nHarry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this\nwasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor,\nblundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and\nfind them in the dark, to warn them.\n\n\"I'm disgusted,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Four students out of bed in\none night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I\nthought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor\nmeant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions --\nyes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around\nschool at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous -- and fifty\npoints will be taken from Gryffindor.\"\n\n\"Fifty?\" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in\nthe last Quidditch match.\n\n\"Fifty points each,\" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily\nthrough her\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL<|>PERSON<|>Professor at Hogwarts, caught Malfoy and the trio out of bed at night, leading to detention and point deduction from Gryffindor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALFOY<|>PERSON<|>Student at Hogwarts, caught by Professor McGonagall for being out at night and lost twenty points for Slytherin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PERSON<|>Student at Hogwarts involved in sneaking out at night with a dragon, caught and received detention along with point deduction for Gryffindor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERMIONE<|>PERSON<|>Student at Hogwarts, part of the trio caught out of bed at night, involved in the Norbert dragon incident)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORBERT<|>PERSON<|>A dragon that Harry and Hermione were caught trying to sneak out of Hogwarts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLIE'S FRIENDS<|>PERSON<|>Individuals who helped Harry and Hermione with the harness for Norbert to transport him safely)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILCH<|>PERSON<|>The caretaker at Hogwarts who caught Harry, Hermione, and Neville out of bed at night)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEVILLE<|>PERSON<|>Student at Hogwarts, tried to warn Harry and Hermione about Malfoy's intentions, also caught and received detention)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL<|>MALFOY<|>Professor McGonagall caught Malfoy and deducted points from Slytherin<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Professor McGonagall caught Harry Potter and assigned detention along with point deduction<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL<|>HERMIONE<|>Professor McGonagall caught Hermione and assigned detention along with point deduction<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>NORBERT<|>Harry was involved in trying to sneak Norbert out of Hogwarts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMIONE<|>NORBERT<|>Hermione was involved in trying to sneak Norbert out of Hogwarts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLIE'S FRIENDS<|>NORBERT<|>Charlie's friends helped in creating a harness for Norbert<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILCH<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Filch caught Harry Potter out of bed at night<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILCH<|>HERMIONE<|>Filch caught Hermione out of bed at night<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILCH<|>NEVILLE<|>Filch caught Neville out of bed at night<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEVILLE<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Neville tried to warn Harry about Malfoy's intentions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEVILLE<|>HERMIONE<|>Neville was caught along with Hermione by Filch<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
