He'd lost two points for Gryffindor\nin his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\"\nsaid Ron, \"Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come\nand meet Hagrid with you?\"\n\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the\ngrounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the\nforbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the\nfront door.\n\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and\nseveral booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang\n-- back.\"\n\nHagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door\nopen.\n\n\"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\"\n\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous\nblack boarhound.\n\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the\nceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner\nstood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\n\n\"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded\nstraight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was\nclearly not as fierce as he looked.\n\n\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a\nlarge teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\n\n\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent\nhalf me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\"\n\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their\nteeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told\nHagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's\nknee and drooled all over his robes.\n\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \"that old git.\"\n\n\"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang\nsometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me\neverywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it.\"\n\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not\nto worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\n\n\"But he seemed to really hate me.\"\n\n\"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\"\n\nYet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes\nwhen he said that.\n\n\"How's yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot --\ngreat with animals.\"\n\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron\ntold Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a\npiece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a\ncutting from the Daily Prophet:\n\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\n\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July,\nwidely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\n\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault\nthat was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\n\n\"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if\nyou know what's good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this\nafternoon.\n\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to\nrob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.\n\n\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!\nIt might've been happening while we were there!\"\n\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes\nthis time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the\nstory again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied\nearlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and\nthirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little\npackage. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\n\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets\nweighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry\nthought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much\nto think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package\njust in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about\nSnape that he didn't want to tell Harry?\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley,\nbut that was before he met Draco Malfoy.\tStill, first-year\nGryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to\nput up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a\nnotice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.\nFlying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and\nSlytherin\twould be\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>One of the four houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, known for bravery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY<|>PERSON<|>Harry Potter, a student at Hogwarts and a member of Gryffindor house)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RON<|>PERSON<|>Ron Weasley, a student at Hogwarts and a member of Gryffindor house, friend of Harry Potter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNAPE<|>PERSON<|>Severus Snape, a professor at Hogwarts, teaches Potions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAGRID<|>PERSON<|>Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts, a friend to Harry and Ron)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FANG<|>PERSON<|>Fang is Hagrid's pet, a large black boarhound)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORBIDDEN FOREST<|>GEO<|>A dangerous area near Hogwarts, home to many magical creatures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRED AND GEORGE<|>PERSON<|>Fred and George Weasley, twin brothers of Ron Weasley, known for their mischief)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
