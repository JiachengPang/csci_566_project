Quirrell\ntook one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly\ndown on a toilet, clutching his heart.\n\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and\nHarry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.\nHopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's\nmind.\n\n\"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with\ncold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with\nhis wand in the air. \"You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in\nyour dormitory?\"\n\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He\nwished Ron would put his wand down.\n\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\n\n\"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me.\"\n\n\"Miss Granger!\"\n\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\n\nI went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it\non my own -- you know, because I've read all about them.\"\n\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a\nteacher? \"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand\nup its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have\ntime to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they\narrived.\"\n\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.\n\n\"Well -- in that case...\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the\nthree of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of\ntackling a mountain troll on your own?\"\n\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last\nperson to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending\nshe had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started\nhanding out sweets.\n\n\"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said\nProfessor McGonagall. \"I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt\nat all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing\nthe feast in their houses.\"\n\nHermione left.\n\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\n\n\"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have\ntaken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five\npoints. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\"\n\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had\nclimbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the\ntroll, quite apart from anything else.\n\n\"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled.\n\n\"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.\"\n\n\"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind\nyou, we did save her.\"\n\n\"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with\nher,\" Harry reminded him.\n\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\n\n\"Pig snout,\" they said and entered.\n\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that\nhad been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting\nfor them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking\nat each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates.\n\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are\nsome things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and\nknocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\nQUIDDITCH\n\nAs they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains\naround the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every\nmorning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the\nupstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled\nup in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous\nbeaverskin boots.\n\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in\nhis first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If\nGryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house\nchampionship.\n\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as\ntheir secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news\nthat he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know\nwhich was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people\ntelling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\n\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't\nknow how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what\nwith all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She\nhad also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a\nvery interesting read.\n\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\nQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup\nmatch in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest\nplayers, and that most\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
