In the\nweeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it\ndidn't look as though he'd cracked yet.\n\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and\nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was\nstill growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper,\nwhich surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed\nQuirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron\nhad started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.\n\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She\nhad started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.\nHarry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the\nsame.\n\n\"Hermione, the exams are ages away.\"\n\n\"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That's not ages, that's like a second to\nNicolas Flamel.\"\n\n\"But we're not six hundred years old,\" Ron reminded her. \"Anyway, what\nare you studying for, you already know it A.\"\n\n\"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass\nthese exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I\nshould have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten\ninto me....\"\n\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines\nas Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter\nholidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard\nto relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's\nblood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron\nspent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get\nthrough all their extra work.\n\n\"I'll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down\nhis quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the\nfirst really fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear,\nforget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\n\nHarry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and\nFungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid! What are you\ndoing in the library?\"\n\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked\nvery out of place in his moleskin overcoat.\n\n\"Jus' lookin',\" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at\nonce. \"An' what're you lot up ter?\" He looked suddenly suspicious. \"Yer\nnot still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\" \"Oh, we found out who he\nis ages ago,\" said Ron impressively. \"And we know what that dog's\nguarding, it's a Sorcerer's St --\"\n\n\"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.\n\"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?\"\n\n\"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said\nHarry, \"about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --\"\n\n\"SHHHH!\" said Hagrid again. \"Listen - come an' see me later, I'm not\npromisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it\nin here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh\n--\"\n\n\"See you later, then,\" said Harry.\n\nHagrid shuffled off.\n\n\"What was he hiding behind his back?\" said Hermione thoughtfully.\n\n\"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\"\n\n\"I'm going to see what section he was in,\" said Ron, who'd had enough of\nworking. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms\nand slammed them down on the table.\n\n\"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!\nLook at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to\nInferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide.\"\n\n\"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever\nmet him, \" said Harry.\n\n\"But it's against our laws,\" said Ron. \"Dragon breeding was outlawed by\nthe Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop\nMuggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden -\nanyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns\nCharlie's got off wild ones in Romania.\"\n\n\"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Of course there are,\" said Ron. \"Common Welsh Green and Hebridean\nBlacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you.\nOur kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to\nmake them forget.\"\n\n\"So what on earths Hagrid up to?\" said Hermione.\n\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later,\nthey were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid\ncalled \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the door\nquickly behind them.\n\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there\nwas a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them\nstoat sandwiches, which they refused.\n\n\"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
