Mind yer step, now! Firs'\nyears follow me!\"\n\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a\nsteep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry\nthought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the\nboy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\n\n\"Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over\nhis shoulder, \"jus' round this bend here.\"\n\nThere was a loud \"Oooooh!\"\n\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.\nPerched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in\nthe starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\n\n\"No more'n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little\nboats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed\ninto their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid,\nwho had a boat to himself. \"Right then -- FORWARD!\"\n\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the\nlake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at\nthe great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer\nand nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\n\n\"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they\nall bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain\nof ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried\nalong a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the\ncastle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they\nclambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\n\n\"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the\nboats as people climbed out of them.\n\n\"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they\nclambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at\nlast onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\n\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak\nfront door.\n\n\"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\"\n\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle\ndoor.\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nTHE SORTING HAT\n\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green\nrobes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought\nwas that this was not someone to cross.\n\n\"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.\n\n\"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\"\n\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have\nfit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit\nwith flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too\nhigh to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to\nthe upper floors.\n\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry\ncould hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right\n-the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall\nshowed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They\ncrowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have\ndone, peering about nervously.\n\n\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term\nbanquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great\nHall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very\nimportant ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be\nsomething like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with\nthe rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free\ntime in your house common room.\n\n\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\nSlytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced\noutstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your\ntriumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose\nhouse points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is\nawarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a\ncredit to whichever house becomes yours.\n\n\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the\nrest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as\nyou can while you are waiting.\"\n\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened\nunder his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to\nflatten his hair.\n\n\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\"Please wait quietly.\"\n\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\n\n\"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron.\n\n\"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he\nwas joking.\"\n\nHarry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole\nschool? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have\nto do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.\nHe looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,\ntoo.
