A few old women were\nsitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was\nsmoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old\nbartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The\nlow buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know\nHagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a\nglass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"\n\n\"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great\nhand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.\n\n\n\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this\nbe --?\"\n\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n\n\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter... what an\nhonor.\"\n\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his\nhand, tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"\n\nHarry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old\nwoman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.\nHagrid was beaming.\n\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry\nfound himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\n\"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last.\"\n\n\"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud.\"\n\n\"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter.\"\n\n\"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus\nDiggle.\"\n\n\"I've seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off\nin his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop.\"\n\n\"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \"Did\nyou hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again --\nDoris Crockford kept coming back for more.\n\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes\nwas twitching.\n\n\"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be\none of your teachers at Hogwarts.\"\n\n\"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand,\n\"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you.\"\n\n\"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\"\n\n\"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as\nthough he'd rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh,\nP-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You'll be g-getting all your\nequipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires,\nm-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought.\n\nBut the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It\ntook almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid\nmanaged to make himself heard over the babble.\n\n\"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\"\n\nDoris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them\nthrough the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was\nnothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\n\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\n\n\"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell\nwas tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'.\"\n\n\"Is he always that nervous?\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was\n\nstudyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand\nexperience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there\nwas a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since.\nScared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me\numbrella?\"\n\nVampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was\ncounting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n\n\"Three up... two across he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\"\n\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\n\nThe brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a\nsmall hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they\nwere facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a\ncobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n\n\"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\"\n\nHe grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry\nlooked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\nback into solid wall.\n\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.\nCauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring\n-- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n\n\"Yeah, you'll be needin' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money\nfirst.\"\n\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every\ndirection as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at\nonce: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their\nshopping.
