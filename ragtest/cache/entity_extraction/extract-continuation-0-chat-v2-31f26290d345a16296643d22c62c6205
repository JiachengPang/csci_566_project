Look in the pockets.\"\nHagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of\nkeys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...\nfinally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\n\n\"Give him five Knuts,\" said Hagrid sleepily.\n\n\"Knuts?\"\n\n\"The little bronze ones.\"\n\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg\nso Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then\nhe flew off through the open window.\n\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\n\n\"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy\nall yer stuff fer school.\"\n\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just\nthought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon\ninside him had got a puncture.\n\n\"Um -- Hagrid?\"\n\n\"Mm?\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\n\n\"I haven't got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he\nwon't pay for me to go and learn magic.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his\nhead. \"D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?\"\n\n\"But if their house was destroyed --\"\n\n\"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is\nGringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I\nwouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither.\"\n\n\"Wizards have banks?\"\n\n\"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\"\n\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\n\n\"Goblins?\"\n\n\"Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never\nmess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer\nanything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o'\nfact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts\nbusiness.\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \"He usually gets me ter do\nimportant stuff fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts --\nknows he can trust me, see.\n\n\"Got everythin'? Come on, then.\"\n\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and\nthe sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was\nstill there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\n\n\"How did you get here?\" Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\n\"Flew,\" said Hagrid.\n\n\"Flew?\"\n\n\"Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've\ngot yeh.\"\n\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to\nimagine him flying.\n\n\"Seems a shame ter row, though,\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another of\nhis sideways looks. \"If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would\nyeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out\nthe pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and\nthey sped off toward land.\n\n\"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"Spells -- enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he\nspoke. \"They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And\nthen yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under\nLondon, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter\nget out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\"\n\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the\nDaily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to\nbe left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never\nhad so many questions in his life.\n\n\"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual,\" Hagrid muttered, turning\nthe page.\n\n\"There's a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop\nhimself.\n\n\"'Course,\" said Hagrid. \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 '\ncourse, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the\njob. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls\nevery morning, askin' fer advice.\"\n\n\"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\"\n\n\"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still\nwitches an' wizards up an' down the country.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their\nproblems. Nah, we're best left alone.\"\n\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall.
