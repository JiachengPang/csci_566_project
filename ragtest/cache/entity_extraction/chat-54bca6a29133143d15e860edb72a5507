Your aunt and I have been\nthinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might\nbe nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.\n\n\"Why?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Don't ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs,\nnow.\"\n\nThe Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\nPetunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one\nwhere Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things\nthat wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip\nupstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He\nsat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was\nbroken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working\ntank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the\ncorner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot\nthrough when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large\nbirdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school\nfor a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent\nbecause Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They\nwere the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been\ntouched.\n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't\nwant him in there... I need that room... make him get out....\"\n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given\nanything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with\nthat letter than up here without it.\n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in\nshock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been\nsick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the\ngreenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was\nthinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the\nletter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each\nother darkly.\n\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice\nto Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with\nhis Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There's\nanother one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'\"\n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\nhall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the\nground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact\nthat Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a\nminute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the\nSmelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with\nHarry's letter clutched in his hand.\n\n\"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry.\n\"Dudley -- go -- just go.\"\n\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out\nof his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first\nletter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure\nthey didn't fail. He had a plan.\n\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry\nturned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the\nDursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\n\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and\nget the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept\nacross the dark hall toward the front door --\n\nHarry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on\nthe doormat -- something alive!\n\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the\nbig, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been\nlying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making\nsure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He\nshouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make\na cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the\ntime he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.\nHarry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\n\nI want --\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into\npieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He\nstayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\n\n\"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if\nthey can't deliver them they'll just give up.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon.\"\n\n\"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not\nlike you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the\npiece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\n\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they\ncouldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,\nslotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small\nwindow in the downstairs bathroom.\n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
