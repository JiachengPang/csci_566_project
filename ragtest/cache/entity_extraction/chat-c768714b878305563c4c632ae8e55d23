Filch must have hurried off to look\nfor them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they\nhardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible\nbetween them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they\nreached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n\n\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their\nbathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n\n\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the\nportrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and\ncollapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\n\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked\nas if he'd never speak again.\n\n\"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up\nin a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one\ndoes.\"\n\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You\ndon't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn't you see\nwhat it was standing on.\n\n\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too\nbusy with its heads.\"\n\n\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously\nguarding something.\"\n\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\n\nI hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed --\nor worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.\"\n\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\n\n\"No, we don't mind,\" he said. \"You'd think we dragged her along,\nwouldn't you.\n\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed\nback into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said?\nGringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to\nhide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.\n\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package\nfrom vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nHALLOWEEN\n\nMalfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were\nstill at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.\nIndeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the\nthree-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite\nkeen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the\npackage that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and\nthey spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy\nprotection. \"It's either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.\n\"Or both,\" said Harry.\n\n\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it\nwas about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what\nit was without further clues.\n\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\nunderneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never\ngoing near the dog again.\n\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a\nbossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really\nwanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great\ndelight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\n\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention\nwas caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech\nowls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in\nthis large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped\nit right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had\nhardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top\nof the parcel.\n\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\n\n\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\n\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody\nknowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood\nwill meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your\nfirst training session.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\n\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to\nread.\n\n\"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I've never even touched\none.\"\n\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private\nbefore their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they\nfound the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the\npackage from Harry and felt it.\n\n\"That's a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\nof jealousy and spite on his face. \"You'll be in for it this time,\nPotter, first years aren't allowed them.\"\n\nRon couldn't resist it.\n\n\"It's not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it's a Nimbus Two Thousand.\nWhat did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron\ngrinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same\nleague as the Nimbus.\"\n\n\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the\nhandle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to\nsave up twig by twig.\"\n\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.\n\n\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.\n\n\"Pot\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
