Draco\nMalfoy looked at him.\n\n\"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father\ntold me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than\nthey can afford.\"\n\nHe turned back to Harry. \"You'll soon find out some wizarding families\nare much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends\nwith the wrong sort. I can help you there.\"\n\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.\n\n\"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said\ncoolly.\n\nDraco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale\ncheeks.\n\n\"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you're a\nbit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know\nwhat was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the\nWeasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you.\"\n\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\n\n\"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\n\n\"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered.\n\n\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because\nCrabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\n\n\"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food\nand you still seem to have some.\"\n\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt\nforward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a\nhorrible yell.\n\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk\ndeep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\nScabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off\nand hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they\nthought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd\nheard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\n\n\"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the\nfloor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\n\nI think he's been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at\nScabbers. \"No -- I don't believe it -- he's gone back to sleep-\"\n\nAnd so he had.\n\n\"You've met Malfoy before?\"\n\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\n\n\"I've heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the\nfirst to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said\nthey'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's\nfather didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to\nHermione. \"Can we help you with something?\"\n\n\"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the\nfront to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't\nbeen fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!\"\n\n\"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would\nyou mind leaving while we change?\"\n\n\"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving\nvery childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a\nsniffy voice. \"And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you\nknow?\"\n\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was\ngetting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple\nsky. The train did seem to be slowing down.\n\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.\nRon's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath\nthem.\n\nA voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hogwarts in five\nminutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken\nto the school separately.\"\n\nHarry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under\nhis freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and\njoined the crowd thronging the corridor.\n\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way\ntoward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in\nthe cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the\nstudents, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs' years! Firs' years\nover here! All right there, Harry?\"\n\nHagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\n\n\"C'mon, follow me -- any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs'\nyears follow me!\"\n\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a\nsteep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry\nthought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the\nboy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\n\n\"Ye'\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
