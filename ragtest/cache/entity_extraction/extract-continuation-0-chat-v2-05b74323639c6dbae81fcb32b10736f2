He couldn't ever remember feeling\nhappier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could\nsay he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never\nsmelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour\nin his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him\nonto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and\ndown, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\n\nHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked\nup at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.\nGryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape....\n\nAnd speaking of Snape...\n\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly\nnot wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the\nforbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He\nrecognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest\nwhile everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?\n\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding\nsilently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He\nfollowed.\n\nThe trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in\ncircles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he\nheard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering\nbeech tree.\n\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his\nbroomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy\nclearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too.\nHarry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering\nworse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\n\n\"... d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,\nSeverus...\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy.\n\"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after\nall.\"\n\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted\nhim.\n\n\"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?\"\n\n\"B-b-but Severus, I --\"\n\n\"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step\ntoward him.\n\n\"I-I don't know what you\n\n\"You know perfectly well what I mean.\"\n\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied\nhimself in time to hear Snape say, \"-- your little bit of hocus-pocus.\nI'm waiting.\"\n\n\"B-but I d-d-don't --\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Snape cut in. \"We'll have another little chat soon, when\nyou've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties\nlie.\"\n\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was\nalmost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as\nthough he was petrified.\n\n\"Harry, where have you been?\" Hermione squeaked.\n\n\"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And\nI gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle\nsingle-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he'll be all\nright - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the\ncommon room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and\nstuff from the kitchens.\"\n\n\"Never mind that now,\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Let's find an empty\nroom, you wait 'til you hear this....\"\n\nHe made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them,\nthen he told them what he'd seen and heard.\n\n\"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to\nforce Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past\nFluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- I reckon\nthere are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of\nenchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts\nspell that Snape needs to break through --\"\n\n\"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to\nSnape?\" said Hermione in alarm.\n\n\"It'll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\nNORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\n\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the\nweeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it\ndidn't look as though he'd cracked yet.\n\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and\nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was\nstill growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper,\nwhich surely meant that the Stone was still safe.
