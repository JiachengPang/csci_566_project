A wild-looking old woman dressed all in\ngreen had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long\npurple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and\nthen walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these\npeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a\ncloser look.\n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated\nthat odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and\nnobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his\nlongest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard\nagain, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his\nnew video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time\nout on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet\nDrive on her crutches.\n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang,\nwho visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite\nhappy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he\ncould see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off\nto secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be\nwith Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private\nschool, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the\nother hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley\nthought this was very funny.\n\n\"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\"\nhe told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet's never had anything as\nhorrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before\nDudley could work out what he'd said.\n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings\nuniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as\nusual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats,\nand she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch\ntelevision and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though\nshe'd had it for several years.\n\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in\nhis brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange\nknickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried\nknobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't\nlooking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said\ngruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst\ninto tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he\nlooked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He\nthought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to\nlaugh.\n\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry\nwent in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in\nthe sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like\ndirty rags swimming in gray water.\n\n\"What's this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always\ndid if he dared to ask a question.\n\n\"Your new school uniform,\" she said.\n\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn't realize it had to be so wet.\"\n\n\"DotA be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old\nthings gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've\nfinished.\"\n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat\ndown at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look\non his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old\nelephant skin, probably.\n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the\nsmell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as\nusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,\non the table.\n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the\ndoormat.\n\n\"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\n\n\"Make Harry get it.\"\n\n\"Get the mail, Harry.\"\n\n\"Make Dudley get it.\"\n\n\"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\"\n\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things\nlay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a\nbill, and -- a letter for Harry.\n\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant\nelastic band.
