Then she turned to the twins.\n\n\"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl\ntelling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --\"\n\n\"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.\"\n\n\"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\"\n\n\"It's not funny. And look after Ron.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already\nand his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\n\n\"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\"\n\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking.\n\n\"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who\nhe is?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Harry Potter!\"\n\nHarry heard the little girl's voice.\n\n\"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....\"\n\n\"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you\ngoggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\"\n\n\"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there - like lightning.\"\n\n\"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite\nwhen he asked how to get onto the platform.\"\n\n\"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks\nlike?\"\n\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\n\n\"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs\nreminding of that on his first day at school.\"\n\n\"All right, keep your hair on.\"\n\nA whistle sounded.\n\n\"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the\ntrain. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and\ntheir younger sister began to cry.\n\n\"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls.\"\n\n\"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\"\n\n\"George!\"\n\n\"Only joking, Mom.\"\n\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their\nsister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train\nuntil it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\n\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the\ncorner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of\nexcitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better\nthan what he was leaving behind.\n\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy\ncame in.\n\n\"Anyone sitting there?\" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.\n\"Everywhere else is full.\"\n\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then\nlooked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw\nhe still had a black mark on his nose.\n\n\"Hey, Ron.\"\n\nThe twins were back.\n\n\"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a\ngiant tarantula down there.\"\n\n\"Right,\" mumbled Ron.\n\n\"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and\nGeorge Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\n\n\"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut\nbehind them.\n\n\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out.\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes,\" said\nRon. \"And have you really got -- you know...\"\n\nHe pointed at Harry's forehead.\n\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\n\n\"So that's where You-Know-Who\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can't remember it.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\" said Ron eagerly.\n\n\"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as\nthough he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out\nof the window again.\n\n\"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as\ninteresting as Ron found him.\n\n\"Er -- Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom's got a second cousin\nwho's an accountant, but we never talk about him.\"\n\n\"So you must know loads of magic already.\"\n\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale\nboy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\n\n\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\"\n\n\"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,\nthough. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers.\"\n\n\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I'm the sixth\nin our family to go to Hogwarts.
