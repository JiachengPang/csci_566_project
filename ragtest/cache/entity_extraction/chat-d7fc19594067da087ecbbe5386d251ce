She\nhad also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a\nvery interesting read.\n\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\nQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup\nmatch in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest\nplayers, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to\nthem; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had\nbeen known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\n\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry\nand Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer\nfor it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them\nwere out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured\nthem up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.\nThey were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape\ncrossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry,\nRon, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view;\nthey were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about\ntheir guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen\nthe fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off\nanyway.\n\n\"What's that you've got there, Potter?\"\n\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\n\n\"Library books are not to be taken outside the school,\" said Snape.\n\"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\"\n\n\"He's just made that rule up,\" Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped\naway. \"Wonder what's wrong with his leg?\"\n\n\"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,\" said Ron bitterly.\n\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and\nHermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and\nRon's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\"How will\nyou learn?\"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right\nanswers anyway.\n\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take\nhis mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of\nSnape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if\nhe could have it.\n\n\"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that\nSnape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.\n\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer.\nHe knocked again. Nothing.\n\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed\nthe door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes.\n\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above\nhis knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing\nSnape bandages.\n\n\"Blasted thing*,\" Snape was saying. \"How are you supposed to keep your\neyes on all three heads at once?\"\n\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but --\n\n\"POTTER!\"\n\nSnape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to\nhide his leg. Harry gulped.\n\n\"I just wondered if I could have my book back.\"\n\n\"GET OUT! OUT!\"\n\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He\nsprinted back upstairs.\n\n\"Did you get it?\" Ron asked as Harry joined them. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen.\n\n\"You know what this means?\" he finished breathlessly. \"He tried to get\npast that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when\nwe saw him -- he's after whatever it's guarding! And Id bet my\nbroomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\"\n\nHermione's eyes were wide.\n\n\"No -- he wouldn't, she said. \"I know he's not very nice, but he\nwouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\"\n\n\"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\"\nsnapped Ron. \"I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But\nwhat's he after? What's that dog guarding?\"\n\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville\nwas snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind\n-- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a\nfew hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his\nleg wasn't easy to forget.\n\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of\nthe delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of\neveryone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\n\n\"You've got to eat some breakfast.\"\n\n\"I don't want anything.\"\n\n\"Just a bit of toast,\" wheedled Hermione.\n\n\"I'm not hungry.\"\n\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.\n\n\"Harry, you need your strength,\" said Seamus Finnigan. \"Seekers are\nalways the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Seamus,\" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\nsausages.\n\nBy eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around\nthe Quidditch pitch.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
