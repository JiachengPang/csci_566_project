I can, can't I?\"\n\n\"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said\nstiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize\nhow risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\"\n\n\"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\"\n\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was\nindoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry,\ntook one look at him, and burst into tears.\n\n\"It's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands.\nI told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only\nthing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a\ndragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter\nlive as a Muggle!\"\n\n\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and\nremorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he'd have\nfound out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have\nfound out even if you hadn't told him.\"\n\n\"Yeh could've died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An' don' say the name!\"\n\n\"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped\ncrying. \"I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up,\nHagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it. Have a Chocolate\nFrog, I've got loads....\"\n\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That reminds\nme.

He\nhad been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving\nhim one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked\nout in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's\nwinning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner\nshowing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\n\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started\ntalking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\nat the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were\nstanding up to look at him.\n\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\n\n\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you\nwith an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our\ndelicious feast.

It was a\nsickening sight.\n\n\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent\nevents must be taken into account.\"\n\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.\n\n\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out.\nLet me see.
