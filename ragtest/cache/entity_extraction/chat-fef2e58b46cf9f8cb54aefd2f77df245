He\nhad clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too,\ncarried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which\n\nFred seized.\n\n\"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even\nHarry got one.\"\n\n\"I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater\nover his head, knocking his glasses askew.\n\n\"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said\n\nGeorge. \"Christmas is a time for family.\"\n\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by\nhis sweater.\n\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred\nfat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of\nchipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy\nand cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet\nalong the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the\nfeeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little\nplastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard\ncracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like\na cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the\ninside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at\nthe High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a\nflowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick\nhad just read him.\n\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his\nteeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid\ngetting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,\nfinally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's\namazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\n\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\nthings out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous\nballoons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.\nThe white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were\ngoing to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.\n\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball\nfight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they\nreturned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in\nhis new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he\nwouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.\n\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,\neveryone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and\nwatch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because\nthey'd stolen his prefect badge.\n\nIt had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been\nnagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed\nwas he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had\nsent it.\n\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,\nfell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his\nfour-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the\ncloak out from under it.\n\nHis father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow\nover his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note\nhad said.\n\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\naround himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and\nshadows. It was a very funny feeling.\n\nUse it well.\n\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him\nin this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the\ndark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch\nwould never know.\n\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back\n-- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he\nwanted to use it alone.\n\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,\nand climbed through the portrait hole.\n\n\"Who's there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked\nquickly down the corridor.\n\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then\nit came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to\nread as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.\nHe set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he\nwalked.\n\nThe library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his\nway along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along\nin midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the\nsight gave him the creeps.\n\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping\ncarefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the\nlibrary, he held up his lamp to read the titles.\n\nThey didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
