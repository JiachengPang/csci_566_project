It showed a\nman's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and\nflowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the\nname Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.\n\n\"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a\nfrog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks\n\nHarry turned over his card and read:\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is\nparticularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in\n1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his\nwork on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore\nenjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\n\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that\nDumbledore's face had disappeared.\n\n\"He's gone!\"\n\n\"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He'll be\nback. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you\nwant it? You can start collecting.\"\n\nRon's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be\nunwrapped.\n\n\"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people\njust stay put in photos.\"\n\n\"Do they? What, they don't move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed. \"weird!\"\n\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and\ngave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than\nlooking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep\nhis eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but\nHengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.\nHe finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was\nscratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.\n\n\"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say\nevery flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the\nordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then\nyou can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-\nflavored one once.\"\n\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a\ncorner.\n\n\"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts.\"\n\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,\ncoconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was\neven brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't\ntouch, which turned out to be pepper.\n\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat\nfields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green\nhills.\n\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced\nboy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He\nlooked tearful.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\"\n\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, \"I've lost him! He keeps getting\naway from me!\"\n\n\"He'll turn up,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him...\"\n\nHe left.\n\n\"Don't know why he's so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I'd brought a toad I'd\nlose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't\ntalk.\"\n\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap.\n\n\"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,\" said Ron in\ndisgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more\ninteresting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look...\"\n\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking\nwand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the\nend.\n\n\"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway\n\nHe had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again.\nThe toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was\nalready wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n\n\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy\nsort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\n\n\"We've already told him we haven't seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl\nwasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n\n\"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.\"\n\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n\n\"Er -- all right.\"\n\nHe cleared his throat.\n\n\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\"\n\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast\nasleep.\n\n\"Are you sure that's a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it's not very\ngood, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's\nall worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such\na surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<|>PERSON<|>Albus Dumbledore is currently the Headmaster of Hogwarts, known for defeating the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, discovering the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and working on alchemy with Nicolas Flamel.
