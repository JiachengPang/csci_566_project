Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a\npassage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - -\nthey plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge\nstalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\n\nI never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,\n\"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"\n\n\"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An' don' ask me questions\njust now, I think I'm gonna be sick.\"\n\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\ndoor in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the\nwall to stop his knees from trembling.\n\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and\nas it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns\nof silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n\n\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.\n\nAll Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about\nthis or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had\nthey complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there\nhad been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\n\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n\n\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to\na Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right,\nthat should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe\nfor yeh.\" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,\nplease, and can we go more slowly?\"\n\n\"One speed only,\" said Griphook.\n\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became\ncolder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went\nrattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to\ntry to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and\npulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\n\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n\n\"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with\none of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\n\n\"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through\nthe door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook.\n\n\"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\n\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\nHarry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous\njewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then\nhe noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on\nthe floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry\nlonged to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.\n\n\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way\nback, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid.\n\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside\nGringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag\nfull of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a\npound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole\nlife -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.\n\n\"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam\nMalkin's Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I\nslipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them\nGringotts carts.\" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam\nMalkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.\n\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\n\n\"Hogwarts, clear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot\nhere -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. \"\n\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on\na footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam\nMalkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his\nhead, and began to pin it to the right length.\n\n\"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry.\n\n\"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street\nlooking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \"Then\nI'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why\nfirst years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting\nme one and I'll smuggle it in somehow.\"\n\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\n\n\"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on.\n\n\"No,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Play Quidditch at all?\"\n\n\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\n\n\"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my\nhouse, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Harry, feeling\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HAGRID<|>PERSON<|>Hagrid is a character who accompanies Harry to Gringotts and helps him with his money.
