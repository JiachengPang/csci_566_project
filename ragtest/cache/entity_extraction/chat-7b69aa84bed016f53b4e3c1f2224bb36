It was old and some of the twigs stuck\nout at odd angles.\n\n\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the\nfront, \"and say 'Up!\"'\n\n\"UPF everyone shouted.\n\nHarry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few\nthat did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and\nNeville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell\nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's\nvoice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the\nground.\n\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding\noff the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\nHarry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it\nwrong for years.\n\n\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said\nMadam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come\nstraight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three\n-- two --\"\n\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the\nground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's\nlips.\n\n\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a\ncork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his\nscared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,\nslip sideways off the broom and --\n\nWHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass\nin a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and\nstarted to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\n\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\n\n\"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy -- it's all right,\nup you get.\".\n\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\n\n\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You\nleave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before\nyou can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear.\"\n\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with\nMadam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\n\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\n\n\"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"\n\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\n\n\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.\n\n\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced\nSlytherin girl. \"Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies,\nParvati.\"\n\n\"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the\ngrass. \"It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him.\"\n\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\n\n\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking\nto watch.\n\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\n\n\"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about --\nup a tree?\"\n\n\"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick\nand taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level\nwith the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it,\nPotter!\"\n\nHarry grabbed his broom.\n\n\"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move --\nyou'll get us all into trouble.\"\n\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom\nand kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed\nthrough his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of\nfierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being\ntaught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up\na little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls\nback on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\n\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked\nstunned.\n\n\"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I'll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh,\nyeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\n\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom\ntightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy\nonly just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and\nheld the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\n\n\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called.\n\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\n\n\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball\nhigh into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\n\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and\nthen start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down\n-- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\n-- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people\nwatching --\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
