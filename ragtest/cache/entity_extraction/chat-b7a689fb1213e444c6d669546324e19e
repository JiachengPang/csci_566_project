Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their\nproblems. Nah, we're best left alone.\"\n\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid\nfolded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the\nstreet.\n\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town\nto the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as\ntall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like\nparking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry? Things these Muggles\ndream up, eh?\"\n\n\"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say\nthere are dragons at Gringotts?\"\n\n\"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I'd like a dragon.\"\n\n\"You'd like one?\"\n\n\"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go.\"\n\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in five\nminutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand \"Muggle money,\" as he\ncalled it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\n\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and\nsat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.\n\n\"Still got yer letter, Harry?\" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry\ntook the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\n\n\"Good,\" said Hagrid. \"There's a list there of everything yeh need.\"\n\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night\nbefore, and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nUNIFORM\n\nFirst-year students will require:\n\n1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)\n\n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear\n\n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)\n\n4.

Although Hagrid seemed to know\nwhere he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an\nordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and\ncomplained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\n\n\"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they\nclimbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined\nwith shops.\n\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do\nwas keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,\nhamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it\ncould sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of\nordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles\nbeneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and\nbroomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had\ncooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of\nhumor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything\nHagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help\ntrusting him.\n\n\"This is it,\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \"the Leaky Cauldron. It's a\nfamous place.\"\n\nIt was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out,\nHarry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't\nglance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the\nrecord shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at\nall. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and\nHagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered\nhim inside.\n\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were\nsitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was\nsmoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old\nbartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The\nlow buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know\nHagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a\nglass, saying, \"The\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
