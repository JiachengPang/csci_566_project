She hadn't spoken to\neither of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.\n\n\"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!\"\nsqueaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as\nusual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic\nwords properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio,\nwho said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a\nbuffalo on his chest.\"\n\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the\nfeather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the\ndesktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and\nset fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.\n\nRon, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.\n\n\"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.\n\n\"You're saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It's Wing-gar-dium\nLevi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.\"\n\n\n\"You do it, then, if you're so clever,\" Ron snarled.\n\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,\n\"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\n\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their\nheads.\n\n\"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here,\nMiss Granger's done it!\"\n\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \"It's no wonder no\none can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the\ncrowded corridor, \"she's a nightmare, honestly. \"\n\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.\nHarry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she\nwas in tears.\n\n\"I think she heard you.\"\n\n\"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must've noticed\nshe's got no friends.\"\n\nHermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all\nafternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast,\nHarry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that\nHermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.\nRon looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had\nentered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out\nof their minds.\n\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a\nthousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the\ncandles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the\ngolden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.\n\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell\ncame sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.\nEveryone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped\nagainst the table, and gasped, \"Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you\nought to know.\"\n\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\n\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from\nthe end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.\n\n\"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories\nimmediately!\"\n\nPercy was in his element.\n\n\"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if\nyou follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years\ncoming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!\"\n\n\"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\n\n\"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe\nPeeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"\n\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.\nAs they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry\nsuddenly grabbed Ron's arm.\n\n\"I've just thought -- Hermione.\"\n\n\"What about her?\"\n\n\"She doesn't know about the troll.\"\n\nRon bit his lip.\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy'd better not see us.\"\n\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped\ndown a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls'\nbathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick\nfootsteps behind them.\n\n\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\n\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the\ncorridor and disappeared from view.\n\n\"What's he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn't he down in the dungeons\nwith the rest of the teachers?\"\n\n\"Search me.\"\n\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's\nfading footsteps.\n\n\"He's heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his\nhand.\n\n\"Can you smell something?\"\n\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\nsocks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\n\nAnd then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of\ngigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left,\nsomething huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and\nwatched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\n\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HERMIONE<|>PERSON<|>Hermione is a student who successfully performed the Wingardium Leviosa spell and was upset by Ron's comments)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY<|>PERSON<|>Harry is a student who struggled with the Wingardium Leviosa spell and noticed Hermione's distress)##\n(\"entity\"<|>RON<|>PERSON<|>Ron is a student who struggled with the Wingardium Leviosa spell and made comments that upset Hermione)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR FLITWICK<|>PERSON<|>Professor Flitwick is teaching the students how to perform the Wingardium Leviosa spell)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEAMUS<|>PERSON<|>Seamus is a student who accidentally set fire to a feather while practicing the Wingardium Leviosa spell)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARVATI PATIL<|>PERSON<|>Parvati Patil is a student who mentioned Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAVENDER<|>PERSON<|>Lavender is a friend of Parvati Patil who heard about Hermione's distress)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR QUIRRELL<|>PERSON<|>Professor Quirrell announced the presence of a troll in the dungeons causing panic)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR DUMBLEDORE<|>PERSON<|>Professor Dumbledore took charge after Professor Quirrell's announcement about the troll)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERCY<|>PERSON<|>Percy is a prefect who led the students back to their dormitories after the troll announcement)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEEVES<|>PERSON<|>Peeves is suspected by Ron to have let the troll in as a Halloween joke)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNAPE<|>PERSON<|>Snape was seen heading towards the third floor instead of the dungeons where the troll was reported)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMIONE<|>RON<|>Hermione was upset by Ron's comments about her<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>HERMIONE<|>Harry noticed Hermione was in tears after Ron's comments<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON<|>PERCY<|>Ron and Harry had to avoid Percy while going to warn Hermione about the troll<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARVATI PATIL<|>HERMIONE<|>Parvati Patil mentioned Hermione's distress to Lavender<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROFESSOR QUIRRELL<|>PROFESSOR DUMBLEDORE<|>Professor Quirrell reported the troll to Professor Dumbledore<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>RON<|>Harry and Ron decided to warn Hermione about the troll together<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>SNAPE<|>Harry and Ron followed Snape after the troll announcement<|>4)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMIONE<|>PROFESSOR FLITWICK<|>Hermione successfully performed the spell under Professor Flitwick's instruction<|>8)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
