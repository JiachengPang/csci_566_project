Little did Harry\nknow that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker\nCurse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were\nready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\n\n\"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron\nslipped his wand up his sleeve.\n\n\"I know,\" Ron snapped. \"Don't nag.\"\n\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\n\n\"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early\ncapture of the Snitch it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor\nHufflepuff too much.\"\n\n\"The whole school's out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the\ndoor. \"Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore's come to watch!\"\n\nHarry's heart did a somersault.\n\n\"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.\nThere was no mistaking that silver beard.\n\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was\nsimply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was\nwatching.\n\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched\nonto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\n\n\"I've never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione. \"Look -they're\noff Ouch!\"\n\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\n\n\"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there.\"\n\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone\nwant a bet? What about you, Weasley?\"\n\nRon didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because\nGeorge Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her\nfingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was\ncircling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\n\n\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said\nMalfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another\npenalty for no reason at all. \"It's people they feel sorry for. See,\nthere's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've\ngot no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no\nbrains.\"\n\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\n\n\"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\" he stammered.\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not\ndaring to take his eyes from the game, said, \"You tell him, Neville.\"\n\n\"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and\nthat's saying something.\"\n\nRon's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety\nabout Harry.\n\n\"I'm warning you, Malfoy -- one more word\n\n\"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry --\"\n\n\"What? Where?\"\n\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and\ncheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her\nmouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\n\n\"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the\nground!\" said Malfoy.\n\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of\nhim, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over\nthe back of his seat to help.\n\n\"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as\nHarry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron\nrolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the\nwhirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\n\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see\nsomething scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next\nsecond, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the\nSnitch clasped in his hand.\n\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember\nthe Snitch being caught so quickly.\n\n\"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won!\nGryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on\nher seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\n\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe\nit. He'd done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five\nminutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land\nnearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his\nshoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.\n\n\"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.\n\"Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping\nbusy... excellent...\"\n\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground.\n\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two\nThousand back to the broomshed.
