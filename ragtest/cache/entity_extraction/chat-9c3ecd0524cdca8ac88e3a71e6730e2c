His\nbroom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to\nhold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild\njerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on\nwith only one hand.\n\n\"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\" Seamus whispered.\n\n\"Can't have,\" Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \"Can't nothing interfere\nwith a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to\na Nimbus Two Thousand.\"\n\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of\nlooking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" moaned Ron, gray-faced.\n\n\"I knew it,\" Hermione gasped, \"Snape -- look.\"\n\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands\nopposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop\nunder his breath.\n\n\"He's doing something -- jinxing the broom,\" said Hermione.\n\n\"What should we do?\"\n\n\"Leave it to me.\"\n\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned\nthe binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was\nalmost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on\nits feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull\nHarry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time\nthey got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower\nand circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.\nMarcus\n\nFlint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.\n\n\"Come on, Hermione,\" Ron muttered desperately.\n\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and\nwas now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say\nsorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.\nReaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a\nfew, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the\nhem of Snape's robes.\n\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.\nA sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him\ninto a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row --\nSnape would never know what had happened.\n\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on\nto his broom.\n\n\"Neville, you can look!\" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into\nHagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.\n\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his\nhand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field\non all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.\n\n\"I've got the Snitch!\" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the\ngame ended in complete confusion.\n\n\"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling\ntwenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken\nany rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results --\nGryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry\nheard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back\nin Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.\n\n\"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him. He was\ncursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.\"\n\n\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next\nto him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do somethin' like that?\"\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell\nhim. Harry decided on the truth.\n\n\"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid. \"He tried to get past\nthat three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying\nto steal whatever it's guarding.\"\n\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\n\n\"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said.\n\n\"Fluffy?\"\n\n\"Yeah -- he's mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub\nlas' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the\n\n\"Yes?\" said Harry eagerly.\n\n\"Now, don't ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"That's top secret,\nthat is.\"\n\n\"But Snape's trying to steal it.\"\n\n\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid again. \"Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do\nnothin' of the sort.\"\n\n\"So why did he just try and kill Harry?\" cried Hermione.\n\nThe afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about\nSnape.\n\nI know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!\n\nYou've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw\nhim!\"\n\n\"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!\" said Hagrid hotly. \"I don' know why\nHarry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student!\nNow, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin' in things that don'\nconcern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what\nit's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
