They had almost reached\nthe portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I\ncan't believe you're going to do this, Harry.\"\n\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe\nand a frown.\n\n\"You!\" said Ron furiously. \"Go back to bed!\"\n\n\"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy -- he's a\nprefect, he'd put a stop to this.\"\n\nHarry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady\nand climbed through the hole.\n\nHermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through\nthe portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\n\n\"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I\ndon't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the\npoints I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching\nSpells.\"\n\n\"Go away.\" \"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said\nwhen you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so --\"\n\nBut what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the\nportrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an\nempty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione\nwas locked out of Gryffindor tower.\n\n\"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly.\n\n\"That's your problem,\" said Ron. \"We've got to go, we 3 re going to be\nlate.\"\n\nThey hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up\nwith them.\n\n\"I'm coming with you,\" she said.\n\n\"You are not.\"\n\n\"D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?\nIf he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying\nto stop you, and you can back me up.\"\n\n\"You've got some nerve --\" said Ron loudly.\n\n\"Shut up, both of you!\" said Harry sharply. I heard something.\"\n\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\n\n\"Mrs. Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\n\nIt wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor,\nfast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\n\n\"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't\nremember the new password to get in to bed.\"\n\n\"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't\nhelp you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere.\"\n\n\"How's your arm?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them. \"Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a\nminute.\"\n\n\"Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you\nlater --\"\n\n\"Don't leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don't want to\nstay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already.\"\n\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and\nNeville.\n\n\"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that\nCurse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\n\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the\nCurse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned\nthem all forward.\n\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the\nhigh windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs.\nNorris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor\nand tiptoed toward the trophy room.\n\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered\nwhere the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues\nwinked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls,\nkeeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took\nout his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes\ncrept by.\n\n\"He's late, maybe he's chickened out,\" Ron whispered.\n\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised\nhis wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy.\n\n\"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\"\n\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly\nat the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried\nsilently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had\nbarely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy\nroom.\n\n\"They're in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding.\"\n\n\"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to\ncreep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch\ngetting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke\ninto a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of\nthem toppled right into a suit of armor.\n\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\n\n\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not\nlooking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
