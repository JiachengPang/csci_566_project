And what model is it?\"\n\n\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the\nlook of horror on Malfoy's face. \"And it's really thanks to Malfoy here\nthat I've got it,\" he added.\n\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's\nobvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it's true,\" Harry chortled as they\nreached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn't stolen Neville's\nRemembrall I wouln't be on the team....\"\n\n\"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?\" came an\nangry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,\nlooking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.\n\n\"I thought you weren't speaking to us?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Yes, don't stop now,\" said Ron, \"it's doing us so much good.\"\n\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\n\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It\nkept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying\nunder his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be\nlearning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without\nnoticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap\nthe Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n\n\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.\n\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\nlooked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long\ntail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold\nnear the top.\n\nAs seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the\ndusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium\nbefore. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that\nthe spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end\nof the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They\nreminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle\n\nchildren blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\n\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\nand kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out\nof the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two\nThousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n\n\"Hey, Potter, come down!'\n\nOliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his\narm. Harry landed next to him.\n\n\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall\nmeant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules\nthis evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.\"\n\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\n\n\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\nif it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.\nThree of them are called Chasers.\"\n\n\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\nabout the size of a soccer ball.\n\n\"This ball's called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the\nQuaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to\nscore a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the\nhoops. Follow me?\"\n\n\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\"\nHarry recited. \"So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with\nsix hoops, isn't it?\"\n\n\"What's basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry\nquickly.\n\n\"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -I'm\nKeeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other\nteam from scoring.\"\n\n\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember\nit all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are\nthey for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n\n\"I'll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\"\n\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\n\n\"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are\nthe Bludgers.\"\n\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\nthe red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to\nescape the straps holding them inside the box.\n\n\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\nBludgers.\n\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then p\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NIMBUS TWO THOUSAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A model of broomstick that Harry Potter received, known for its speed and sleek design)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PERSON<|>Recipient of the Nimbus Two Thousand, a new member of the Quidditch team)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RON WEASLEY<|>PERSON<|>Harry's friend, impressed by the Nimbus Two Thousand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRACO MALFOY<|>PERSON<|>Harry's rival, envious of Harry's new broomstick)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR FLITWICK<|>PERSON<|>Hogwarts professor who inquires about the argument between Harry, Ron, and Malfoy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL<|>PERSON<|>Informed Professor Flitwick about the special circumstances allowing Harry to have a broomstick)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERMIONE GRANGER<|>PERSON<|>Disapproves of Harry breaking rules to receive his Nimbus Two Thousand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVER WOOD<|>PERSON<|>Gryffindor Quidditch team captain, introduces Harry to Quidditch and admires his natural talent)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIDDITCH<|>EVENT<|>A magical sport played on broomsticks, Harry is learning to play and has joined the Gryffindor team)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>NIMBUS TWO THOUSAND<|>Harry Potter received the Nimbus Two Thousand as a gift<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>RON WEASLEY<|>Ron Weasley is Harry Potter's close friend and supports him<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>DRACO MALFOY<|>Draco Malfoy is envious and antagonistic towards Harry Potter<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PROFESSOR FLITWICK<|>Professor Flitwick inquires about Harry's broomstick upon Draco Malfoy's prompt<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL<|>Professor McGonagall informed Flitwick about Harry's special circumstances for receiving a broomstick<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>HERMIONE GRANGER<|>Hermione Granger disapproves of how Harry Potter received his Nimbus Two Thousand<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>OLIVER WOOD<|>Oliver Wood introduces Harry Potter to Quidditch and sees potential in him<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>QUIDDITCH<|>Harry Potter joins the Quidditch team and learns to play the sport<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OLIVER WOOD<|>QUIDDITCH<|>Oliver Wood is the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
