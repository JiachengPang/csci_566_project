He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to\nhim, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was\nhis destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it\ngot heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened\npainfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with\nit -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh\nbecame high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke,\nsweating and shaking.\n\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he\ndidn't remember the dream at all.\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nTHE POTIONS MASTER\n\nThere, look.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\"\n\n\"Wearing the glasses?\"\n\n\"Did you see his face?\"\n\n\"Did you see his scar?\"\n\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next\nday. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look\nat him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.\nHarry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on\nfinding his way to classes.\n\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,\nsweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different\non a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to\nremember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you\nasked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors\nthat weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It\nwas also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed\nto move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit\neach other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\n\nThe ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of\nthem glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly\nHeadless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right\ndirection, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a\ntrick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would\ndrop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet,\npelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab\nyour nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\"\n\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus\nFilch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their\nvery first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a\ndoor that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds\ncorridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was\nsure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening\nto lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor\nQuirrell, who was passing.\n\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature\nwith bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the\ncorridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of\nline, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds\nlater. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than\nanyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly\nas any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest\nambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\n\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes\nthemselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out,\nthan waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\n\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\nWednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the\nmovements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the\ngreenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little\nwitch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of\nall the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.\n\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only\none taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old\n\nindeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got\nup next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on\nand on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the\nEvil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\n\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had\nto stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their\nfirst class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he\ngave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\n\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to\nthink she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a\ntalking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.\n\n\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you\nwill learn at Hogwarts,\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
