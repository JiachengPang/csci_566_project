Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to\nhis great relief, Harry wasn't punished.\n\nOn the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on\nthe roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as\nusual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was\nsitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter\nfrom Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school\nbuildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon\nthrough the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash\ncans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have\ncaught him in mid- jump.\n\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with\nDudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school,\nhis cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.\n\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to\ncomplain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the\nbank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,\nit was motorcycles.\n\n\"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a\nmotorcycle overtook them.\n\nI had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It\nwas flying.\"\n\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right\naround in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet\nwith a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\"\n\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\n\nI know they don't,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\"\n\nBut he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the\nDursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking\nabout anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a\ndream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous\nideas.\n\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The\nDursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the\nentrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry\nwhat he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap\nlemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they\nwatched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,\nexcept that it wasn't blond.\n\nHarry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to\nwalk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who\nwere starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall\nback on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo\nrestaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker\nglory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him\nanother one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\n\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to\nlast.\n\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in\nthere, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts\nof lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and\nstone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick,\nman-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the\nplace. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car\nand crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in\nthe mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the\nglistening brown coils.\n\n\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the\nglass, but the snake didn't budge.\n\n\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly\nwith his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\n\n\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\n\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He\nwouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no\ncompany except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying\nto disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a\nbedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door\nto wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised\nits head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
