Know what house you'll be in yet?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\n\n\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know\nI'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in\nHufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing\nhe could say something a bit more interesting.\n\n\"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the\nfront window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing\nat two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.\n\n\"That's Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.\n\"He works at Hogwarts.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't\nhe?\"\n\n\"He's the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less\nevery second.\n\n\"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the\nschool grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,\nand ends up setting fire to his bed.\"\n\n\"I think he's brilliant,\" said Harry coldly.\n\n\"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you? Where\nare your parents?\"\n\n\"They're dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into\nthe matter with this boy.\n\n\"Oh, sorry,\" said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were\nour kind, weren't they?\"\n\n\"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're\njust not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some\nof them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,\nimagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.\nWhat's your surname, anyway?\"\n\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That's you done, my\ndear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy,\nhopped down from the footstool.\n\n\"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy.\n\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\n(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\n\n\"What's up?\" said Hagrid.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry\ncheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you\nwrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what's Quidditch?\"\n\n\"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin'\nabout Quidditch!\"\n\n\"Don't make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate\nboy in Madam Malkin's.\n\n\"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed\nin.\"\n\n\"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown\nup knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what\neveryone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what\ndoes he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones\nwith magic in 'em in a long line 0' Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look\nwhat she had fer a sister!\"\n\n\"So what is Quidditch?\"\n\n\"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle\nworld -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on\nbroomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules.\"\n\"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\"\n\n\"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o'\nduffers, but --\"\n\n\"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff\" said Harry gloomily.\n\n\"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There's not a\nsingle witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.\nYou-Know-Who was one.\"\n\n\"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\"\n\n\"Years an' years ago,\" said Hagrid.\n\nThey bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts\nwhere the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as\npaving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in\ncovers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with\nnothing in them at all.
