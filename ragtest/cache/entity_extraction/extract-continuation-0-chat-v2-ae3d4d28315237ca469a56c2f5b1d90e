Hermione\nwouldn't hear of it.\n\n\"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\nhatching?\"\n\n\"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what\nHagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing --\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Harry whispered.\n\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How\nmuch had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.\n\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,\nHermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during\nmorning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their\nlesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried\nthrough the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them,\nlooking flushed and excited.\n\n\"It's nearly out.\" He ushered them inside.\n\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something\nwas moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\n\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated\nbreath.\n\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby\ndragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought\nit looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge\ncompared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils,\nthe stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.\n\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\n\n\"Isn't he beautiful?\" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke\nthe dragon's head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\n\n\"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid.\n\n\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione, \"how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,\nexactly?\"\n\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face\n-- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid --\nhe's runnin' back up ter the school.\"\n\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no\nmistaking him.\n\nMalfoy had seen the dragon.\n\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week\nmade Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their\nfree time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\n\n\"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" said Hagrid. \"He's too little. He'd die.\"\n\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a\nweek. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing\nhis gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There\nwere empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\n\n\"I've decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon\nwith misty eyes. \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert!\nWhere's Mommy?\"\n\n\"He's lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry's ear.\n\n\"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert's going to\nbe as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\"\n\nHagrid bit his lip.\n\n\"I -- I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I\ncan't.\"\n\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said.\n\n\"You're losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I'm Ron, remember?\"\n\n\"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.\nWe could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put\nhim back in the wild!\"\n\n\"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\"\n\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to\nask him.\n\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry\nsitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to\nbed. The clock on the wall had just\n\nchimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of\nnowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at\nHagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by\nthe crate.\n\n\"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a\nbloody handkerchief. \"I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a\nweek. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met,\nbut the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little\nbunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when\nI left, he was singing it a lullaby.\"\n\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\n\n\"It's Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She'll have\nCharlie's answer!\"\n\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note.\n\nDear Ron,\n\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian\nRidgeback\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HEDWIG<|>PERSON<|>Hedwig is an owl that delivers messages for Harry and his friends)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAGRID<|>PERSON<|>Hagrid is a friend of Harry, Ron, and Hermione who comes into possession of a dragon egg that hatches into a Norwegian Ridgeback)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY<|>PERSON<|>Harry is one of the main characters who is involved in the discovery and care of the dragon, Norbert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RON<|>PERSON<|>Ron is one of Harry's best friends who is involved in the plan to care for and eventually send the dragon away)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERMIONE<|>PERSON<|>Hermione is one of Harry's best friends who is concerned about the consequences of keeping the dragon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORBERT<|>PERSON<|>Norbert is the baby Norwegian Ridgeback dragon that Hagrid raises from an egg)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALFOY<|>PERSON<|>Malfoy is a fellow student who discovers the existence of Norbert and poses a threat of exposing the secret)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLIE<|>PERSON<|>Charlie is Ron's brother who studies dragons in Romania and is suggested as someone who could take care of Norbert)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAGRID<|>NORBERT<|>Hagrid cares for Norbert after the dragon hatches from its egg<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>HEDWIG<|>Harry receives messages delivered by Hedwig<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON<|>CHARLIE<|>Ron suggests sending Norbert to his brother Charlie in Romania<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMIONE<|>HAGRID<|>Hermione expresses concern to Hagrid about the consequences of keeping Norbert<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MALFOY<|>HAGRID<|>Malfoy poses a threat to Hagrid by potentially exposing the secret of Norbert<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>RON<|>Harry and Ron are best friends and together plan to care for Norbert<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>HERMIONE<|>Harry and Hermione are best friends and together with Ron plan to care for Norbert<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON<|>HERMIONE<|>Ron and Hermione are best friends and together with Harry plan to care for Norbert<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORBERT<|>CHARLIE<|>Norbert is planned to be sent to Charlie for care and to be put back into the wild<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
