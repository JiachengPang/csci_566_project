{"result": "The Dursleys, consisting of Harry's aunt, uncle, and cousin, are his non-magical relatives who have raised him since the death of his parents. They are a Muggle family, meaning they possess no magical abilities themselves and have gone to great lengths to keep Harry's magical heritage a secret from him. Despite their crucial role in his upbringing, the Dursleys have deliberately kept Harry unaware of his true wizarding background, his fortune, and his significant place within the wizarding world. Their relationship with Harry is marked by their efforts to maintain a normal, magic-free environment, which includes taking him to mundane places like King's Cross Station, albeit for magical reasons unknown to them. Living with the Dursleys outside of his time at Hogwarts, Harry has been kept in the dark about his parents' legacy and his own potential in the magical realm.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
