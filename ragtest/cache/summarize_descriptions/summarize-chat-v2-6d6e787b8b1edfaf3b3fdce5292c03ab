{"result": "Percy Weasley is a character from the Harry Potter series who plays a significant role as a prefect at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As a member of the Weasley family, Percy is notably Ron Weasley's older brother and is recognized for his dedication to his duties and his family. His responsibilities as a prefect include guiding first-year students to the Gryffindor common room, explaining the dangers of Peeves the poltergeist, and leading students back to their dormitories during emergencies, such as the announcement of a troll in the school. Percy's commitment to his role is further highlighted by his actions in receiving new robes as part of his prefect duties and sharing his youngest brother's achievements with other prefects, showcasing his pride in his family. Despite his strict adherence to rules, there are moments when his actions could potentially interfere with the plans of other characters, such as Harry and Ron. Contrary to one description, Percy is not the oldest brother in the Weasley family but is one of the older siblings, with Bill and Charlie being older than him. His character arc includes moments of tension and reconciliation within the Weasley family, illustrating his complex relationship with his siblings and his growth throughout the series.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
