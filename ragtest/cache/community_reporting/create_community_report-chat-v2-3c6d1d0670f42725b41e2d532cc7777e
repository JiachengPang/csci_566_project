Known for his bullying behavior towards Harry, Dudley is depicted as a character with a penchant for physical aggression, including punching Harry and leading a gang that bullies him. Despite his tough exterior, Dudley shows signs of fear towards Harry's magical capabilities, especially after finding out Harry is a wizard, which leads to a complex relationship between the two cousins.\n\nDudley's curiosity about Harry's world is evident in his attempts to read Harry's Hogwarts acceptance letters and his reactions to the magical incidents that occur around Harry, such as the episode at the zoo where Dudley falsely claims a snake nearly bit off his leg after Harry unintentionally uses magic. This incident, among others, highlights Dudley's exaggerated and often self-centered nature.\n\nDudley's life is marked by indulgence, as seen in the lavish birthday celebrations his parents throw for him, which include numerous gifts like a racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. His acceptance into Smeltings, Uncle Vernon's old private school, further underscores the privileged yet sheltered life he leads.\n\nDespite his initial antagonism towards Harry, Dudley's character shows signs of growth. His fear of Harry's magical abilities and the consequences of his family's actions, including a humorous yet humbling moment when he is given a pig's tail by Hagrid, suggest a budding awareness and complexity in Dudley's character. This is further evidenced by his interest in television programs and his ability to remember the days of the week, indicating a certain level of intelligence and curiosity.\n\nIn summary, Dudley Dursley is a multifaceted character who evolves from Harry Potter's primary Muggle antagonist to a cousin who exhibits a grudging awareness of the magical world and its impact on his family.

This mistreatment is part of a broader pattern of abuse from the family towards Harry, which also includes Harry having to wear Dudley's old clothes, highlighting the disparity in their treatment despite their familial relationship. The dynamic between them is further complicated by Dudley being directly affected by Harry's change in living arrangements, particularly in relation to the altercation over Harry's letters.
