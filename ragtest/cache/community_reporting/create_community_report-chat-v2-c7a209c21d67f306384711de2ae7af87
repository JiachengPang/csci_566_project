This event earned him the title \"\"the boy who lived\"\" among wizards. Harry is the son of Lily and James Potter and was raised by the Dursleys, his non-magical aunt and uncle, in a rather unkind environment, living under the stairs in their house.\n\nDespite his small and skinny appearance, Harry is recognized for his bravery and magical abilities. He discovers he is a wizard on his eleventh birthday when Hagrid informs him of his acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This marks the beginning of his journey into the magical world, where he is celebrated for his celebrity status, especially noted during his visit to the Leaky Cauldron.\n\nAs a student at Hogwarts, Harry quickly stands out not only for his fame but also for his natural talent in Quidditch, becoming the youngest Seeker for the Gryffindor team in a century after catching a Remembrall during his first flying lesson. His adventures at Hogwarts include exploring the forest with Hagrid and Hermione, interacting with Quirrell and Voldemort, and discovering the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry's bravery is highlighted when he is awarded sixty points for Gryffindor for pure nerve and outstanding courage.\n\nHarry's magical journey is marked by significant milestones, such as receiving his first wand made of holly and phoenix feather, indicating his destiny for great things, and being chosen by the Sorting Hat for his house assignment. Despite losing Gryffindor 150 points, he redeems himself as the hero of two Quidditch matches and is involved in various adventures, including sneaking out at night with a dragon, which leads to detention and a point deduction for Gryffindor.\n\nHarry's relationship with the Dursleys is strained, as indicated by Mr. Dursley's reaction to overhearing a conversation about Harry, revealing Harry's significance in the context of unusual events and his relation to Mr. Dursley.
