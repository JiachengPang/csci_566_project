{"result": "Hedwig is Harry Potter's pet owl, known for her distinctive white plumage, although she is depicted in some instances as having brown feathers. She plays a crucial role in Harry's life, accompanying him to King's Cross and serving as a reliable messenger. Hedwig is used for delivering important messages, including a note from Hagrid about the hatching of a dragon egg, and she is a source of companionship for Harry throughout his adventures.
