{"result": "Nearly Headless Nick, also known as Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, is the resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is primarily associated with Gryffindor House, where he plays a supportive role by helping new Gryffindors navigate the school and encouraging them in their efforts to win the house championship. Despite his strong ties to Gryffindor, there is a conflicting description that suggests he is also associated with Slytherin House, which is inaccurate.
