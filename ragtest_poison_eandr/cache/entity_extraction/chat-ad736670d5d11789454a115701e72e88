She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being\nout of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had\ncaught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who\nNicolas Flamel was.\n\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary\nbook, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere.\nOnce term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten\nminutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other\ntwo, because Quidditch practice had started again.\n\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that\nhad replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys\ncomplained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's\nside. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would\novertake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven\nyears. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer\nnightmares when he was tired out after training.\n\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave\nthe team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the\nWeasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off\ntheir brooms.\n\n\"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. \"That's exactly the sort of\nthing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll\nbe looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\"\n\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\n\n\"Snape's refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When's\nhe ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we\nmight overtake Slytherin.\"\n\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\n\n\"It's not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We've just got to make sure we play a\nclean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us.\"\n\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for\nnot wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....\n\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the\nend of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common\nroom, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only\nthing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very\ngood for her.\n\n\"Don't talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to\nhim, \"I need to concen --\" He caught sight of Harry's face. \"What's the\nmatter with you? You look terrible.\"\n\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other\ntwo about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\n\n\"Don't play,\" said Hermione at once.\n\n\"Say you're ill,\" said Ron.\n\n\"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested.\n\n\"Really break your leg,\" said Ron.\n\n\"I can't,\" said Harry. \"There isn't a reserve Seeker. If I back out,\nGryffindor can't play at all.\"\n\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed\nto climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs\nhad been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the\nLeg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to\nGryffindor tower.\n\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed\nthe countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet,\ntrembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit\nwith Harry and Ron.\n\n\"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He said\nhe'd been looking for someone to practice that on.\"\n\n\"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report him!\"\n\nNeville shook his head.\n\n\"I don't want more trouble,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron. \"He's used to\nwalking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of\nhim and make it easier.\"\n\n\"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,\nMalfoy's already done that,\" Neville choked out.\n\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog,\nthe very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He\ngave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.\n\n\"You're worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you\nfor Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\"\n\nNeville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\n\n\"Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed.... D'you want the card, you\ncollect them, don't you?\"\n\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\n\n\"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever-\"\n\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron\nand Hermione.\n\n\"I've found him!\" he whispered. \"I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read\nthe name somewhere before, I read it\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
