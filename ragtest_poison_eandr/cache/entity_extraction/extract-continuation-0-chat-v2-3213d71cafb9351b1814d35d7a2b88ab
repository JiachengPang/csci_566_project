He turned his head in every\ndirection as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at\nonce: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their\nshopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as\nthey passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're\nmad....\"\n\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl\nEmporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of\nabout Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with\nbroomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus\nTwo Thousand -- fastest ever --\" There were shops selling robes, shops\nselling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen\nbefore, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes,\ntottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion\nbottles, globes of the moon....\n\n\"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid.\n\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\nlittle shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a\nuniform of scarlet and gold, was -\n\n\"Yeah, that's a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\nstone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.\nHe had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very\nlong fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were\nfacing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved\nupon them:\n\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\n\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\n\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\n\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\n\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\n\nA treasure that was never yours,\n\nThief, you have been warned, beware\n\nOf finding more than treasure there.\n\n\"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,\" said Hagrid.\n\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\nvast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high\nstools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing\ncoins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.\nThere were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more\ngoblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made\nfor the counter.\n\n\"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We've come ter take some money\noutta Mr. Harry Potter's safe.\"\n\n\"You have his key, Sir?\"\n\n\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\npockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits\nover the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry\nwatched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as\nglowing coals.\n\n\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\n\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\n\n\"That seems to be in order.\"\n\n\"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid\nimportantly, throwing out his chest. \"It's about the YouKnow-What in\nvault seven hundred and thirteen.\"\n\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have Someone\ntake you down to both vaults. Griphook!\"\n\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\nbiscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward\none of the doors leading off the hall.\n\n\"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" Harry\nasked.\n\n\"Can't tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts\nbusiness. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh\nthat.\"\n\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more\nmarble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with\nflaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little\nrailway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came\nhurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some\ndifficulty -- and were off.\n\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry\ntried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left,\nbut it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way,\nbecause Griphook wasn't steering.\n\nHarry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them\nwide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a\npassage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - -\nthey plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge\nstalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\n\nI never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,\n\"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"\n\n\"Stalag\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HAGRID<|>PERSON<|>Hagrid is a character who accompanies Harry Potter and is responsible for taking him to Gringotts to access his vault.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PERSON<|>Harry Potter is a young wizard and the main character who is visiting Gringotts to access his money.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Eeylops Owl Emporium<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eeylops Owl Emporium is a shop that sells various types of owls, including Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy owls.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Gringotts<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gringotts is a snowy white building that serves as a bank for wizards, where Harry Potter has a vault.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Professor Dumbledore<|>PERSON<|>Professor Dumbledore is a trusted figure in the wizarding world who has sent a letter regarding a secret in vault 713.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Griphook<|>PERSON<|>Griphook is a goblin who works at Gringotts and assists Hagrid and Harry in accessing their vaults.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>vault seven hundred and thirteen<|>EVENT<|>Vault seven hundred and thirteen is a secret vault at Gringotts that contains something important related to Hogwarts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAGRID<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Hagrid is taking Harry Potter to Gringotts to access his vault, indicating a mentor-mentee relationship<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>GRINGOTTS<|>Harry Potter is a customer at Gringotts, where he is accessing his vault<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAGRID<|>GRINGOTTS<|>Hagrid is leading Harry Potter to Gringotts to access his vault<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROFESSOR DUMBLEDORE<|>HAGRID<|>Hagrid has a letter from Professor Dumbledore regarding vault seven hundred and thirteen, indicating a relationship of trust<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRIPHOOOK<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Griphook is assisting Harry Potter in accessing his vault at Gringotts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRIPHOOOK<|>HAGRID<|>Griphook is assisting Hagrid and Harry Potter in accessing their vaults at Gringotts<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRINGOTTS<|>vault seven hundred and thirteen<|>Vault seven hundred and thirteen is located within Gringotts, indicating a direct relationship<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
