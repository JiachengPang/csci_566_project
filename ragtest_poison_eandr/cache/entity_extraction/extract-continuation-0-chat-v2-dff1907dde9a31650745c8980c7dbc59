Scabbers stayed gray and fast\nasleep.\n\n\"Are you sure that's a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it's not very\ngood, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's\nall worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such\na surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I\nmean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard --\nI've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it\nwill be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you.\n\nShe said all this very fast.\n\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he\nhadn't learned all the course books by heart either.\n\n\"I'm Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered.\n\n\"Harry Potter,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course -- I\ngot a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern\nMagical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great\nWizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\n\n\"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed.\n\n\"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it\nwas me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what house you'll be in?\nI've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far\nthe best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw\nwouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's\ntoad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there\nsoon.\"\n\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\n\n\"Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,\" said Ron. He threw his\nwand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he\nknew it was a dud.\"\n\n\"What house are your brothers in?\" asked Harry.\n\n\"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"Mom\nand Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I\ndon't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in\nSlytherin.\"\n\n\"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\n\n\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,\"\nsaid Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses. \"So what do your\noldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?\"\n\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.\n\n\"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing\nsomething for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about\n\nGringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you\nget that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security\nvault.\"\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\"Really? What happened to them?\"\n\n\"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My\ndad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts,\nbut they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course,\neveryone gets scared when something like this happens in case\nYou-Know-Who's behind it.\"\n\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a\nprickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this\nwas all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more\ncomfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying.\n\n\"What's your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked.\n\n\"Er -- I don't know any,\" Harry confessed.\n\n\"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the\nworld --\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the\npositions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to\nwith his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the\nmoney. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game\nwhen the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the\ntoadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\n\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was\nthe pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with\na lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.\n\n\"Is it true?\" he said. \"They're saying all down the train that Harry\nPotter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were\nthickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale\nboy, they looked like bodyguards.\n\n\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly,\nnoticing where Harry was looking. \"And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\"\n\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco\nMalfoy looked at him.\n\n\"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are.
