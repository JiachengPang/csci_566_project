Hadn't he set a boa\nconstrictor on him?\n\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively\nbeaming at him.\n\n\"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be\nright famous at Hogwarts.\"\n\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight.\n\n\"Haven't I told you he's not going?\" he hissed. \"He's going to Stonewall\nHigh and he'll be grateful for it.

Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled\nit over his head, \"NEVER,\" he thundered, \"- INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDORE-\nIN- FRONT- OF- ME!\"\n\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley\n-- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a\nsharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with\nhis hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned\nhis back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in\nhis trousers.\n\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other\nroom, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door\nbehind them.\n\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\n\n\"Shouldn'ta lost me temper,\" he said ruefully, \"but it didn't work\nanyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like\na pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do.\"\n\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\n\n\"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he\nsaid. \"I'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'.

Although he could tell it was\ndaylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.\n\n\"It was a dream, he told himself firmly. \"I dreamed a giant called\nHagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open\nmy eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard.\"\n\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\n\nAnd there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart\nsinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good\ndream.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\n\"All right,\" Harry mumbled, \"I'm getting up.\"\n\nHe sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of\nsunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed\nsofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper\nheld in its beak.\n\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon\nwas swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it\nopen. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who\ndidn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to\nattack Hagrid's coat.\n\n\"Don't do that.\"\n\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak\nfiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\n\n\"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \"There's an owl\n\n\"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"He wants payin' fer deliverin\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PERSON<|>Harry Potter is a young boy who is about to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, known for his unique background and magical potential.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAGRID<|>PERSON<|>Hagrid is the gamekeeper at Hogwarts and a giant who has come to inform Harry about his acceptance to the school.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOGWARTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a prestigious school for young witches and wizards where Harry is set to attend.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<|>PERSON<|>Albus Dumbledore is the headmaster of Hogwarts, known for his wisdom and powerful magic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUDLEY DURSLEY<|>PERSON<|>Dudley Dursley is Harry's cousin, who is often portrayed as spoiled and bullying towards Harry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>PERSON<|>Uncle Vernon is Harry's uncle, who is dismissive of Harry's magical abilities and insists he should attend a regular school.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>PERSON<|>Aunt Petunia is Harry's aunt, who also disapproves of Harry's magical background and upbringing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIAGON ALLEY<|>EVENT<|>Diagon Alley is a magical marketplace where wizards and witches can buy supplies for their magical education.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>HAGRID<|>Hagrid is responsible for bringing Harry the news of his acceptance to Hogwarts and guiding him into the wizarding world<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAGRID<|>HOGWARTS<|>Hagrid works at Hogwarts and is instrumental in Harry's introduction to the school<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<|>HOGWARTS<|>Dumbledore is the headmaster of Hogwarts, overseeing the education and welfare of students<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUDLEY DURSLEY<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Dudley is Harry's cousin and often bullies him, representing the non-magical world Harry is escaping from<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Uncle Vernon is Harry's guardian who opposes Harry's magical education and wants him to attend a regular school<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Aunt Petunia is also a guardian of Harry who disapproves of his magical background<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAGRID<|>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<|>Hagrid respects Dumbledore and acknowledges his authority at Hogwarts<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>DIAGON ALLEY<|>Harry is set to visit Diagon Alley to gather supplies for his upcoming education at Hogwarts<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
