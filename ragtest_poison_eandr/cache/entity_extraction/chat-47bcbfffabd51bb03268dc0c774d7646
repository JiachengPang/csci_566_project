To the waist, a\nman, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming\nchestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws\ndropped.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\"\n\nHe walked forward and shook the centaur's hand.\n\n\"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful\nvoice. \"Were you going to shoot me?\"\n\n\"Can't be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.\n\"There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an'\nHermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is\nRonan, you two. He's a centaur.))\n\n\"We'd noticed,\" said Hermione faintly.\n\n\"Good evening,\" said Ronan. \"Students, are you? And do you learn much,\nup at the school?\"\n\n\"Erm --\"\n\n\"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly.\n\n\"A bit. Well, that's something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head\nand stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I'm glad we've run inter\nyeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?\"\n\nRonan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then\nsighed again.\n\n\"Always the innocent are the first victims,\" he said. \"So it has been\nfor ages past, so it is now.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan? Anythin'\nunusual?\"\n\n\"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him\nimpatiently. \"Unusually bright.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said\nHagrid. \"So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?\"\n\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \"The forest\nhides many secrets.\"\n\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,\nbut it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and\nwilder-looking than Ronan.\n\n\"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\"\n\n\"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\"\n\n\"Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in\nhere lately? There's a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin'\nabout it?\"\n\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \"Mars is\nbright tonight,\" he said simply.\n\n\"We've heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. \"Well, if either of you do see\nanythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then.\"\n\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their\nshoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\n\n\"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, \"try an' get a straight answer out of a\ncentaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"Are there many of them in here?\" asked Hermione.\n\n\"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're\ngood enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind,\ncentaurs... they know things... jus' don' let on much.\"\n\n\"D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's\nbin killin' the unicorns -- never heard anythin' like it before.\"\n\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking\nnervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being\nwatched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.\nThey had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's\narm.\n\n\"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\"\n\n\"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Stay on the path, I'll come back\nfor yeh!\"\n\nThey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking\nat each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the\nrustling of leaves around them.\n\n\"You don't think they've been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione.\n\n\"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville... it's our\nfault he's here in the first place.\"\n\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's\nseemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.\nWhat was going on? Where were the others?\n\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy,\nNeville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed,\nhad sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had\npanicked and sent up the sparks.\n\n\"We'll be\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
