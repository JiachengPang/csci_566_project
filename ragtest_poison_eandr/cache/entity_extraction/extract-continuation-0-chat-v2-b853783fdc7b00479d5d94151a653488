Send him, we can afford to lose\nhim.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next\nday for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.\nWhen he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a\nsmall pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\n\n\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\npulled on his bathrobe.\n\n\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I've got some presents!\"\n\n\"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which\nwas a lot bigger than Harry's.\n\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\nscrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut\nwooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it --\nit sounded a bit like an owl.\n\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.\n\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle\nVernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.\n\n\"That's friendly,\" said Harry.\n\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\n\n\"Weird!\" he said, 'NMat a shape! This is money?\"\n\n\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid\nand my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?\"\n\n\"I think I know who that one's from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and\npointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn't expect\nany presents and -- oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she's made you a Weasley\nsweater.\"\n\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in\nemerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\n\n\"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and\nmine's always maroon.\"\n\n\"That's really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was\nvery tasty.\n\nHis next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs\nfrom Hermione.\n\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very\nlight. He unwrapped it.\n\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it\nlay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\n\n\"I've heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\nEvery Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. \"If that's what I think it\nis -- they're really rare, and really valuable.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to\nthe touch, like water woven into material.\n\n\"It's an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I'm\nsure it is -- try it on.\"\n\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\n\n\"It is! Look down!\"\n\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the\nmirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head\nsuspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak\nover his head and his reflection vanished completely.\n\n\"There's a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\"\n\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow,\nloopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your\nfather left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was\nreturned to you. Use it well.\n\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\n\n\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the\ncloak.\n\n\"I'd give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What's the\nmatter?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had\nit really once belonged to his father?\n\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung\nopen and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak\nquickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else\nyet.\n\n\"Merry Christmas!\"\n\n\"Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!\"\n\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on\nit, the other a G.\n\n\"Harry's is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry's\nsweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.\"\n\n\"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it\non, they're lovely and warm.\"\n\n\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\n\n\"You haven't got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she\nthinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're\ncalled Gred and Forge.\"\n\n\"What's all th is noise.\n\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He\nhad clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too,\ncarried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which\n\nFred seized.\n\n\"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even\nHarry got one.\"\n\n\"I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HARRY<|>PERSON<|>Harry is a character who received various Christmas presents, including an invisibility cloak and a Weasley sweater.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RON<|>PERSON<|>Ron is Harry's friend who shares Christmas with him and receives a Weasley sweater.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAGRID<|>PERSON<|>Hagrid is a character who sent Harry a wooden flute as a Christmas present.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>PERSON<|>Uncle Vernon is Harry's relative who sent him a fifty-pence piece for Christmas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>PERSON<|>Aunt Petunia is Harry's relative who sent him a fifty-pence piece for Christmas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEASLEY SWEATER<|>EVENT<|>The Weasley sweater is a hand-knitted garment made by Ron's mother, given as a Christmas present.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INVISIBILITY CLOAK<|>EVENT<|>The invisibility cloak is a magical item that belonged to Harry's father and was returned to Harry as a Christmas gift.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRED WEASLEY<|>PERSON<|>Fred is Ron's brother who enters the dormitory and comments on Harry's Weasley sweater.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEORGE WEASLEY<|>PERSON<|>George is Ron's brother who enters the dormitory and comments on Harry's Weasley sweater.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERCY WEASLEY<|>PERSON<|>Percy is Ron's brother who disapproves of the noise and is also wearing a Weasley sweater.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>RON<|>Harry and Ron are friends who celebrate Christmas together and exchange gifts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAGRID<|>HARRY<|>Hagrid sent Harry a Christmas present, a wooden flute<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>HARRY<|>Uncle Vernon sent Harry a fifty-pence piece for Christmas<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>HARRY<|>Aunt Petunia sent Harry a fifty-pence piece for Christmas<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON<|>WEASLEY SWEATER<|>Ron received a Weasley sweater from his mother for Christmas<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>INVISIBILITY CLOAK<|>Harry received the invisibility cloak as a Christmas gift, which belonged to his father<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRED WEASLEY<|>HARRY<|>Fred commented on Harry's Weasley sweater, indicating a friendly relationship<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEORGE WEASLEY<|>HARRY<|>George commented on Harry's Weasley sweater, indicating a friendly relationship<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERCY WEASLEY<|>RON<|>Percy is Ron's brother and they share a familial relationship, with Percy disapproving of the noise<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
