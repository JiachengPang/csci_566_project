Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke\ninto a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of\nthem toppled right into a suit of armor.\n\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\n\n\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not\nlooking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead,\nwithout any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped\nthrough a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled\nalong it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was\nmiles from the trophy room.\n\n\"I think we've lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall\nand wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and\nspluttering.\n\nI -- told -you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,\n\"I -- told -- you.\"\n\n\"We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that, don't\nyou? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to\nbe in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\"\n\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her\nthat.\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nIt wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen\npaces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a\nclassroom in front of them.\n\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\n\n\"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out.\"\n\nPeeves cackled.\n\n\"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty,\nnaughty, you'll get caughty.\"\n\n\"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please.\"\n\n\"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his\neyes glittered wickedly. \"It's for your own good, you know.\"\n\n\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a\nbig mistake.\n\n\"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE\nCHARMS CORRIDOR\"\n\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the\ncorridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.\n\n\"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We're\ndone for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as\nfast as he could toward Peeves's shouts.\n\n\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the\nlock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!\"\n\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut\nit quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\n\n\"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\"\n\n\"Say 'please.\"'\n\n\"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\"\n\n\"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,\" said Peeves in his\nannoying singsong voice.\n\n\"All right -please.\"\n\n\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say\nplease! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing\naway and Filch cursing in rage.\n\n\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we'll be okay\n-- get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of\nHarry's bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\"\n\nHarry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he\nwas sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of\neverything that had happened so far.\n\nThey weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The\nforbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was\nforbidden.\n\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that\nfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads.\nThree pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching\n\nand quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging\nin slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\n\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry\nknew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their\nsudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting\nover that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\n\nHarry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take\nFilch.\n\nThey fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they\nalmost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look\nfor them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they\nhardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible\nbetween them and that monster.
