If she was really there, he'd touch her, their\nreflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the\nothers existed only in the mirror.\n\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her\neyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the\nglass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that\nshe was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin,\nblack-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore\nglasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as\nHarry's did.\n\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching\nthat of his reflection.\n\n\"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\"\n\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the\nfaces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green\neyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as\nthough he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family,\nfor the first time in his life.\n\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\nthem, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping\nto fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache\ninside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\n\nHow long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade\nand he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his\nsenses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He\ntore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, \"I'll come back,\"\nand hurried from the room.\n\n\"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly.\n\n\"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.\n\n\"I'd like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly.\n\n\"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to\nshow me your other brothers and everyone.\"\n\n\"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house\nthis summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not\nfinding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you\neating anything?\"\n\nHarry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them\nagain tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very\nimportant anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?\nWhat did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\n\n\"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\"\n\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror\nroom again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much\nmore slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the\nlibrary, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\n\n\"I'm freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let's forget it and go back.\"\n\n\"No!\" Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere.\"\n\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction,\nbut saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead\nwith cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.\n\n\"It's here -- just here -- yes!\"\n\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his\nshoulders and ran to the mirror.\n\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\n\n\"See?\" Harry whispered.\n\n\"I can't see anything.\"\n\n\"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them....\"\n\n\"I can only see you.\"\n\n\"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\"\n\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't\nsee his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\n\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\n\n\"Look at me!\" he said.\n\n\"Can you see all your family standing around you?\"\n\n\"No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head\nboy!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the\nhouse cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too.\n\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at\nHarry.\n\n\"Do you think this mirror shows the future?\"\n\n\"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --\"\n\n\"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\"\n\n\"You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I\nwant to see my parents.\"\n\n\"Don't push me --\"\n\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.\nThey hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.\n\n\"Quick!\"\n\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris\ncame round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the\nsame thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she\nturned and left.\n\n\"This isn't safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.\nCome on.\"\n\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\n\nThe snow still hadn't melted the next morning.\n\n\"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?\"\n\n\"No... you go...\"\n\n\"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror.
