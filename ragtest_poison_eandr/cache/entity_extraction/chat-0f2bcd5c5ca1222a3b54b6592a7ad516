When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when\nI left, he was singing it a lullaby.\"\n\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\n\n\"It's Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She'll have\nCharlie's answer!\"\n\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note.\n\nDear Ron,\n\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian\nRidgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing\nwill be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to\nvisit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal\ndragon.\n\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on\nSaturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still\ndark.\n\nSend me an answer as soon as possible.\n\nLove,\n\nCharlie\n\nThey looked at one another.\n\n\"We've got the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn't be too\ndifficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and\nNorbert.\"\n\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two\nagreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.\n\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to\ntwice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam\nPomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though,\nhe had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked\nas if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.\n\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day\nto find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\n\n\"It's not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it's\nabout to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of\nmy books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept\nthreatening to tell her what really bit me -- I've told her it was a\ndog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the\nQuidditch match, that's why he's doing this.\"\n\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\n\n\"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this\ndidn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke\ninto a sweat.\n\n\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no -- I've\njust remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's\ngoing to know we're getting rid of Norbert.\"\n\nHarry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came\nover at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\n\n\"It's too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven't\ngot time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance\nto get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the\ninvisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that.\"\n\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail\nwhen they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\n\n\"I won't let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert's at a tricky stage -- nothin'\nI can't handle.\"\n\nWhen they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears,\nalthough that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the\nleg.\n\n\"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only\na baby, after all.\"\n\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry\nand Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come\nquickly enough.\n\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say\ngood-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had\nto do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late\narriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get\nout of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis\nagainst the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\n\n\"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in\na muffled voice. \"An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets\nlonely.\"\n\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as\nthough the teddy was having his head torn off.\n\n\"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the\ncrate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.\n\"Mommy will never forget you!\"\n\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never\nknew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble\nstaircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another\nstaircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the\nwork much easier.\n\n\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the\ntallest tower.\n\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.\nForgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the\nshadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each\nother ten feet away.
