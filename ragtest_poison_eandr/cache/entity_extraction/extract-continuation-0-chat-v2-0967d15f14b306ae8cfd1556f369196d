Most of them had never\nseen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly\nnormal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made\nseveral important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a\nvery good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs\nand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n\nHe'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\nthem next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't\nknow why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering\nexcitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on\nhis way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he\ncaught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"\n\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better\nof it.\n\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\nsecretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost\nfinished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the\nreceiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was\nbeing stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were\nlots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think\nof it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even\nseen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point\nin worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her\nsister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all\nthe same, those people in cloaks...\n\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and\nwhen he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that\nhe walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It\nwas a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a\nviolet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the\nground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in\na squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir,\nfor nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at\nlast! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,\nhappy day!\"\n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\nstranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that\nwas. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping\nhe was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he\ndidn't approve of imagination.\n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --\nand it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that\nmorning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the\nsame one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n\n\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a\nstern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying\nto pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still\ndetermined not to mention anything to his wife.\n\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\nabout Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\nlearned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When\nDudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to\ncatch the last report on the evening news:\n\n\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's\nowls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally\nhunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been\nhundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since\nsunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly\nchanged their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin.\n\"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going\nto be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"\n\n\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don't know about that, but it's not\nonly the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as\nKent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead\nof the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting\nstars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's\nnot until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\n\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair.
