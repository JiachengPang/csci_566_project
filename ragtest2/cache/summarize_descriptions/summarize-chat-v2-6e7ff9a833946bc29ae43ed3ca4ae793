{"result": "Harry Potter has a profound and significant connection to You-Know-Who, the dark wizard who serves as the main antagonist in his life. This connection is rooted in a tragic past, as You-Know-Who is responsible for the death of Harry's parents and is infamous for having attempted to kill Harry himself when he was just a baby. Remarkably, Harry survived this attack, which not only marked him as a target for You-Know-Who but also contributed to his fame within the wizarding world.
