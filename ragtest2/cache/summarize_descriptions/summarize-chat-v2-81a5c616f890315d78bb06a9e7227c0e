{"result": "Severus Snape is a complex character and the Potions Master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is known for his cold demeanor, strict teaching style, and favoritism towards Slytherin students. Snape has a complicated relationship with Harry Potter, often perceived as an antagonist due to his harsh treatment of Harry and his friends, particularly during their time at Hogwarts. His past is intertwined with that of Harry's father, adding layers to their interactions.\n\nThroughout the series, Snape is suspected of various malevolent intentions, including jinxing Harry's broom during a Quidditch match and attempting to steal the Sorcerer's Stone, which he is believed to want for Voldemort. Despite these suspicions, Snape's character is revealed to have deeper motivations, as he is ultimately shown to be protective of Harry in certain situations. His involvement in darker aspects of Hogwarts events, such as the trap involving the three-headed dog, further complicates his character.\n\nSnape's intimidating presence creates a tense atmosphere, especially during exams, and he is known for punishing students, particularly Harry.
