He was tall, thin, and\ngangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to\n--\"\n\n\"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\n\n\"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the\nbarrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared\nyou'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a\nrun if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\"\n\n\"Er -- okay,\" said Harry.\n\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very\nsolid.\n\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to\nplatforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash\nright into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward\non his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer\nand nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control\n-- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --\n\nIt didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet\nsteam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign\noverhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind him\nand saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the\nwords Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.\n\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,\nwhile cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls\nhooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and\nthe scraping of heavy trunks.\n\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging\nout of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.\nHarry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.\nHe passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I've lost my toad\nagain.\"\n\n\"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh.\n\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\n\n\"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\"\n\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him\nshrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\n\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment\nnear the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started\nto shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it\nup the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it\npainfully on his foot.\n\n\"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through\nthe barrier.\n\n\"Yes, please,\" Harry panted.\n\n\"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!\"\n\nWith the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner\nof the compartment.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\n\n\"What's that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's\nlightning scar.\n\n\"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you\n\n\"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren't you?\" he added to Harry.\n\n\"What?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Harry Potter, \"chorused the twins.\n\n\"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\"\n\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to\nhis relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.\n\n\"Fred? George? Are you there?\"\n\n\"Coming, Mom.\"\n\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\n\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the\nred-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their\nmother had just taken out her handkerchief.\n\n\"Ron, you've got something on your nose.\"\n\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and\nbegan rubbing the end of his nose.\n\n\"Mom -- geroff\" He wriggled free.\n\n\"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the\ntwins.\n\n\"Shut up,\" said Ron.\n\n\"Where's Percy?\" said their mother.\n\n\"He's coming now.\"\n\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his\nbillowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge\non his chest with the letter P on it.\n\n\"Can't stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I'm up front, the prefects have got\ntwo compartments to themselves --\"\n\n\"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of\ngreat surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\"\n\n\"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the\nother twin. \"Once --\"\n\n\"Or twice --\"\n\n\"A minute --\"\n\n\"All summer --\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect.\n\n\"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins.\n\n\"Because he's a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear,\nwell, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there.\"\n\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\n\n\"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
