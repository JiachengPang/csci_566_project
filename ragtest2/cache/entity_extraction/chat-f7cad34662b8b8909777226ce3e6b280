Percy could be heard telling the other\nprefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past\nMcGonagall's giant chess set!\"\n\nAt last there was silence again.\n\n\"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the\nface of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\n\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had\nburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside\nthemselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"Third -- to Mr. Harry\nPotter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve\nand outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"\n\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves\nhoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points\n-- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if\nonly Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\n\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\n\n\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a\ngreat deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to\nstand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville\nLongbottom.\"\n\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some\nsort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted\nfrom the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and\ncheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people\nhugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.\nHarry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who\ncouldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the\nBody-Bind Curse put on him.\n\n\"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even\nRavenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we\nneed a little change of decoration.\"\n\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet\nand the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a\ntowering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor\nMcGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye\nand Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed\none jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back\nto normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\n\nIt was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at\nQuidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would\nnever, ever forget tonight.\n\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but\ncome they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good\nmarks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even\nNeville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his\nabysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid\nas he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a\nshame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.\n\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,\nNeville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were\nhanded out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the\nholidays (\"I always hope they'll forget to give us these,\" said Fred\nWeasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats\nthat sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express;\ntalking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier;\neating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns;\npulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling\ninto platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.\n\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened\nold guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate\nin twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out\nof a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\n\n\"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you -- I'll\nsend you an owl.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I'll need something to look forward to.\" People\njostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle\nworld. Some of them called:\n\n\"Bye, Harry!\"\n\n\"See you, Potter!\"\n\n\"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.\n\n\"Not where I'm going, I promise you,\" said Harry.\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \"There he is,\nMom, there he is, look!\"\n\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at\nRon.\n\n\"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see\n\n\"Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point.\"\n\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\n\n\"Busy year?\" she said.\n\n\"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.\nWeasley.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\"\n\n\"Ready, are you?\"\n\nIt was Uncle Vernon,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
