Don't be afraid!\n\nAnd don't get in a flap!\n\nYou're in safe hands (though I have none)\n\nFor I'm a Thinking Cap!\"\n\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It\nbowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\n\n\"So we've just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I'll\nkill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"\n\nHarry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than\nhaving to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on\nwithout everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot;\nHarry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If\nonly the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy,\nthat would have been the one for him.\n\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of\nparchment.\n\n\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to\nbe sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\"\n\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the\nhat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause\n--\n\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat.\n\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at\nthe Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving\nmerrily at her.\n\n\"Bones, Susan!\"\n\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next\nto Hannah.\n\n\"Boot, Terry!\"\n\n\"RAVENCLAW!\"\n\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws\nstood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\n\n\" Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\"\nbecame the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded\nwith cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.\n\n\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's\nimagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they\nlooked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick\nnow. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.\nHe had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but\nbecause no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\n\n\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"\n\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"\n\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at\nothers it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the\nsandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost\na whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\n\n\"Granger, Hermione!\"\n\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\n\n\"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\n\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when\nyou're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just\nsat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor\nMcGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a\nmistake and he'd better get back on the train?\n\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called,\nhe fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide\nwith Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off\nstill wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it\nto \"MacDougal, Morag.\"\n\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at\nonce: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\"\n\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with\nhimself.\n\nThere weren't many people left now. \"Moon\" \"Nott\" \"Parkinson\" then a\npair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" and\nthen, at last -- \"Potter, Harry!\"\n\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little\nhissing fires all over the hall.\n\n\"Potter, did she say?\"\n\nThe Harry Potter?\"\n\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the\nhall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he\nwas looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\n\nHmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty\nof courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness,\nyes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting....\nSo where shall I put you?\"\n\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not\nSlytherin.\n\n\"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be\ngreat, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you\non the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure\n-- better be GRYFFINDOR!\"\n\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
