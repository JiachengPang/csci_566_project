Three things\nlay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a\nbill, and -- a letter for Harry.\n\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant\nelastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who\nwould? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the\nlibrary, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet\nhere it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\n\n4 Privet Drive\n\nLittle Whinging\n\nSurrey\n\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the\naddress was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax\nseal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake\nsurrounding a large letter H.\n\n\"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you\ndoing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke.\n\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed\nUncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to\nopen the yellow envelope.\n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over\nthe postcard.\n\n\"Marge's ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk. --.\"\n\n\"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry's got something!\"\n\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the\nsame heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of\nhis hand by Uncle Vernon.\n\n\"That's mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\n\n\"Who'd be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open\nwith one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster\nthan a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds\nit was the grayish white of old porridge.\n\n\"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.\n\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it\nhigh out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first\nline. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her\nthroat and made a choking noise.\n\n\"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!\"\n\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\nDudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He\ngave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\n\n\"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. want to read it,\" said\nHarry furiously, \"as it's mine.\"\n\n\"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back\ninside its envelope.\n\nHarry didn't move.\n\nI WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted.\n\n\"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley.\n\n\"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\nscruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the\nkitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but\nsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry,\nhis glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at\nthe crack between door and floor.\n\n\"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the\naddress -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think\nthey're watching the house?\"\n\n\"Watching -- spying -- might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon\nwildly.\n\n\"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't\nwant --\"\n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the\nkitchen.\n\n\"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an\nanswer... Yes, that's best... we won't do anything....\n\n\"But --\"\n\n\"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took\nhim in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\"\n\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd\nnever done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\n\n\"Where's my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed\nthrough the door. \"Who's writing to me?\"\n\n\"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly.\n\"I have burned it.\"\n\n\"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\"\n\n\"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the\nceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a\nsmile, which looked quite painful.\n\n\"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been\nthinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might\nbe nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.\n\n\"Why?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Don't ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs,\nnow.\"\n\nThe Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
