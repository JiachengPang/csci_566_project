She bent down\nand gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and\nenjoy the sunshine.\"\n\nBut they didn't.\n\n\"It's tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was\nout of earshot. \"Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found\nout everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He\nsent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when\nDumbledore turns up.\"\n\n\"But what can we --\"\n\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\n\nSnape was standing there.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly.\n\nThey stared at him.\n\n\"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd,\ntwisted smile.\n\n\"We were --\" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\n\n\"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around\n\nlike this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor\nreally can't afford to lose any more points, can it?\"\n\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\n\n\"Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will\npersonally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\"\n\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\n\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\n\n\"Right, here's what we've got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us\nhas got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and\nfollow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that.\"\n\n\"Why me?\"\n\n\"It's obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor\nFlitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \"'Oh Professor Flitwick,\nI'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for\nSnape.\n\n\"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron.\n\"Come on.\"\n\nBut that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the\ndoor separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor\nMcGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\n\n\"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of\nenchantments!\" she stormed. \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you 've\ncome anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from\nGryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\" Harry and Ron went back to\nthe common room, Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione's on Snape's\ntail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came\nin.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Harry!\" she wailed. \"Snape came out and asked me what I was\ndoing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him,\nand I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went.\"\n\n\"Well, that's it then, isn't it?\" Harry said.\n\nThe other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\n\n\"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone\nfirst.\"\n\n\"You're mad!\" said Ron.\n\n\"You can't!\" said Hermione. \"After what McGonagall and Snape have said?\nYou'll be expelled!\"\n\n\"SO WHAP\" Harry shouted. \"Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of\nthe Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like\nwhen he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get\nexpelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark\nArts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think\nhe'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house\ncup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to\ngo back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's\nonly dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over\nto the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing\nyou two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\"\n\nHe glared at them.\n\n\"You're right Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice.\n\n\"I'll use the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It's just lucky I got it\nback.\"\n\n\"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron.\n\n\"All -- all three of us?\"\n\n\"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you'd get to\nthe Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there\nmight be something useful...\"\n\n\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\"\n\n\"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in\nsecret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not\nthrowing me out after that.\"\n\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.\nNobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to\nHarry any more\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
