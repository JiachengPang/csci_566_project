They were the last\npeople you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,\nbecause they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did\nhave a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she\nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the\nneighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their\nopinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't\nthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.\nPotter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;\nin fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her\nsister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was\npossible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the\nPotters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy\nwas another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want\nDudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the\ncountry. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for\nwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\nDudley into his high chair.\n\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,\nbecause Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the\nwalls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got\ninto his car and backed out of number four's drive.\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\nsomething peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley\ndidn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\nlook again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet\nDrive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking\nof? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and\nstared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the\ncorner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now\nreading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats\ncouldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and\nput the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of\nnothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in\nfunny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this\nwas some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering\nwheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite\nclose by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was\nenraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man\nhad to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\nnerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some\nsilly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...\nyes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.\nDursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\nninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate\non drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad\ndaylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed\nopen- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never\nseen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly\nnormal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made\nseveral important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a\nvery good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs\nand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n\nHe'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\nthem next to the baker's.
