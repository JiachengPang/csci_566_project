Bit keen, aren't yeh?\"\n\n\"Oh, we're not working,\" Harry told him brightly. \"Ever since you\nmentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is.\"\n\n\"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop\nit. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'.\"\n\n\"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,\" said Hermione.\n\n\"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added. \"We\nmust've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him\nanywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere.\"\n\n\"I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.\n\n\"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left\nHagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\n\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid\nhad let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape\nwas trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to\nbegin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a\nbook. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable\nMagical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern\nMagical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And\nthen, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of\nthousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\n\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to\nsearch while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them\noff the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted\nSection. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in\nthere. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the\nteachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never\nget one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never\ntaught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced\nDefense Against the Dark Arts.\n\n\"What are you looking for, boy?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry.\n\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\n\n\"You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!\"\n\nWishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left\nthe library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not\nask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be\nable to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were\nup to.\n\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\nanything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two\nweeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it\nwasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a\nnice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\n\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.\nThey went off to lunch.\n\n\"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?\" said Hermione. \"And\nsend me an owl if you find anything.\"\n\n\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron.\n\"It'd be safe to ask them.\"\n\n\"Very safe, as they're both dentists,\" said Hermione.\n\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time\nto think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the\ncommon room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the\ngood armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they\ncould spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows\n-- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk\nabout even if they wouldn't work.\n\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like\nMuggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot\nlike directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered.\nLike everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in\nhis family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen\nweren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble\ngetting them to do what he wanted.\n\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't\ntrust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept\nshouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don't\nsend me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose\nhim.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next\nday for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.\nWhen he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a\nsmall pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\n\n\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\npulled on his bathrobe.\n\n\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this?
