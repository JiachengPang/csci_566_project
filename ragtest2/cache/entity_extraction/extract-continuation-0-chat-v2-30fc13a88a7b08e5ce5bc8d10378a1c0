This was part of his and Wood's game plan.\n\n\"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had\nsaid. \"We don't want you attacked before you have to be.\"\n\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to\nlet off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch.\nOnce he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection\nfrom one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to\ncome pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry\ndodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\n\n\"All right there, Harry?\" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger\nfuriously toward Marcus Flint.\n\n\"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey ducks\ntwo Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the --\nwait a moment -- was that the Snitch?\"\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too\nbusy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his\nleft ear.\n\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the\nstreak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck\nand neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have\nforgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to\nwatch.\n\nHarry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings\nfluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed --\n\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint\nhad blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry\nholding on for dear life.\n\n\"Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors.\n\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the\ngoal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the\nGolden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.\n\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \"Send him off, ref! Red\ncard!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, Dean?\" said Ron.\n\n\"Red card!\" said Dean furiously. \"In soccer you get shown the red card\nand you're out of the game!\"\n\n\"But this isn't soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him.\n\nHagrid, however, was on Dean's side.\n\n\"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the\nair.\"\n\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\n\n\"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating\n\n\"Jordan!\" growled Professor McGonagall.\n\n\"I mean, after that open and revolting foul\n\n'Jordan, I'm warning you --\"\n\n\"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which\ncould happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by\nSpinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor\nstill in possession.\"\n\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously\npast his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening\nlurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped\nthe broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt\nanything like that.\n\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him\noff. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their\nriders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts\n-- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he\nrealized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't\nturn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the\nair, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that\nalmost unseated him.\n\nLee was still commentating.\n\n\"Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet --\npasses Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose\n-- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...\n\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's\nbroom was behaving strangely. It was carrying- him slowly higher, away\nfrom the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\n\n\"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing,\" Hagrid mumbled. He stared through\nhis binoculars. \"If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of\nhis broom... but he can't have....\"\n\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His\nbroom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to\nhold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild\njerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on\nwith only one hand.\n\n\"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\" Seamus whispered.\n\n\"Can't have,\" H\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HAGRID<|>PERSON<|>Hagrid is a character who is observing the Quidditch game and commenting on the actions of the players, particularly Harry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY<|>PERSON<|>Harry is a Quidditch player who is seeking the Golden Snitch during the game and is experiencing issues with his broom.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOOD<|>PERSON<|>Wood is a character who is part of the Quidditch team and has given Harry advice on how to play during the game.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANGELINA<|>PERSON<|>Angelina is a Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team who scores during the game.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRED WEASLEY<|>PERSON<|>Fred Weasley is a character who is chasing a Bludger during the Quidditch match.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLYTHERIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slytherin is one of the teams competing in the Quidditch match against Gryffindor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gryffindor is the team that Harry plays for in the Quidditch match.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCUS FLINT<|>PERSON<|>Marcus Flint is a player on the Slytherin team who is involved in a foul against Harry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN SNITCH<|>EVENT<|>The Golden Snitch is a small, winged ball that Harry is trying to catch during the Quidditch match.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUDGER<|>EVENT<|>A Bludger is a type of ball in Quidditch that can knock players off their brooms, which Harry narrowly avoids.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIMBUS TWO THOUSAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nimbus Two Thousand is the model of broomstick that Harry is riding during the Quidditch match.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>WOOD<|>Wood is advising Harry on how to play Quidditch effectively<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANGELINA<|>HARRY<|>Angelina scores a goal, contributing to the Gryffindor team's performance in the match<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRED WEASLEY<|>HARRY<|>Fred Weasley is chasing a Bludger while Harry is focused on the Snitch, indicating teamwork<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARCUS FLINT<|>HARRY<|>Marcus Flint commits a foul against Harry during the match, impacting the game dynamics<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>GOLDEN SNITCH<|>Harry is actively trying to catch the Golden Snitch, which is the objective of his role in the game<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>NIMBUS TWO THOUSAND<|>Harry is riding the Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick during the Quidditch match<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>BLUDGER<|>Harry dodges a Bludger while trying to catch the Golden Snitch, showing the dangers of the game<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>SLYTHERIN<|>Gryffindor and Slytherin are competing teams in the Quidditch match<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
