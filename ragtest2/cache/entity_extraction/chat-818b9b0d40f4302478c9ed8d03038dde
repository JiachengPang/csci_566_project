You could say I've got a lot to live up\nto. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie\nwas captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess\naround a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks\nthey're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,\nbut if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get\nanything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes,\nCharlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.\"\n\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was\nasleep.\n\n\"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy\ngot an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff\n-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\"\n\nRon's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he\nwent back to staring out of the window.\n\nHarry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to\nafford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a\nmonth ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old\nclothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer\nRon up.\n\n\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a\nwizard or about my parents or Voldemort\"\n\nRon gasped.\n\n\"What?\" said Harry.\n\n\"You said You-Know-Who's name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and\nimpressed. \"I'd have thought you, of all people --\"\n\n\"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, I\njust never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to\nlearn.... I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that\nhad been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I'm the worst in the class.\"\n\n\"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and\nthey learn quick enough.\"\n\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.\nNow they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were\nquiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\n\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\ncorridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,\n\"Anything off the cart, dears?\"\n\nHarry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears\nwent pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went\nout into the corridor.\n\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he\nhad pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many\nMars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What\nshe did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best\nBlowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice\nWands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his\nlife. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid\nthe woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\n\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped\nit onto an empty seat.\n\n\"Hungry, are you?\"\n\n\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\n\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four\nsandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She always\nforgets I don't like corned beef.\"\n\n\"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on --\"\n\n\"You don't want this, it's all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn't got much\ntime,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\"\n\n\"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share\nbefore or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling,\nsitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties,\ncakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\n\n\"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.\n\"They're not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel that\nnothing would surprise him.\n\n\"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside\nthem, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about\nfive hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\"\n\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a\nman's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and\nflowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the\nname Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.\n\n\"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a\nfrog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks\n\nHarry turned over his card and read:\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
