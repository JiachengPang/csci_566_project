How\nmany people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law?\nLucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the\ngrounds toward the forest, didn't answer.\n\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and\nsleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\n\n\"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\"\n\n\"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\n\n\"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know\nthat night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards\nwith look like?\"\n\n\"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn' take his cloak off.\"\n\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head --\nthat's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn'\nhe? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\"\n\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \"What did you talk to him\nabout, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\"\n\n\"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.\n\"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here....\nHe asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told\nhim... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an'\nthen... I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks....\nLet's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play\ncards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he\ndidn' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a\ndragon would be easy...\"\n\n\"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, try ing\nto keep his voice calm.\n\n\"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around\nHogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to\ncalm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off\nter sleep --\"\n\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\n\n\"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey --\nwhere're yeh goin'?\"\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they\ncame to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy\nafter the grounds.\n\n\"We've got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger\nhow to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that\ncloak -- it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope\nDumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop\nhim. Where's Dumbledore's office?\"\n\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the\nright direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor\ndid they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\n\n\"We'll just have to --\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across\nthe hall.\n\n\"What are you three doing inside?\"\n\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\n\n\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely,\nHarry and Ron thought.\n\n\"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though\nthis was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\"\n\nHarry swallowed -- now what?\n\n\"It's sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because\nProfessor McGonagall's nostrils flared.\n\n\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He\nreceived an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for\nLondon at once.\"\n\n\"He's gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\"\n\n\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many\ndemands on his time --\n\n\"But this is important.\"\n\n\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic,\nPotter.\n\n\"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor -- it's\nabout the Sorcerer's tone --\"\n\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books\nshe was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up.\n\"How do you know --?\" she spluttered.\n\n\"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone's going to try\nand steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\"\n\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\n\n\"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. I don't\nknow how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can\npossibly steal it, it's too well protected.\"\n\n\"But Professor --\"\n\n\"Potter, I know what I'm talking about,\" she said shortly.
