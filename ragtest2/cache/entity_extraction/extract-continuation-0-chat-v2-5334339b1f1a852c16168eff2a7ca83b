As they\ncouldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,\nslotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small\nwindow in the downstairs bathroom.\n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\nout a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and\nback doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\"\nas he worked, and jumped at small noises.\n\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to\nHarry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each\nof the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt\nPetunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious\ntelephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone\nto complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\n\n\"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in\namazement.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking\ntired and rather ill, but happy.\n\n\"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade\non his newspapers, \"no damn letters today --\"\n\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught\nhim sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty\nletters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys\nducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.\n\n\"Out! OUT!\"\n\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.\nWhen Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their\nfaces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters\nstill streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n\n\"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling\ngreat tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back\nhere in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some\nclothes. No arguments!\"\n\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared\nargue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the\nboarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.\nDudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the\nhead for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and\ncomputer in his sports bag.\n\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they\nwere going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and\ndrive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake'em off... shake 'em\noff,\" he would mutter whenever he did this.\n\nThey didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was\nhowling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd\nmissed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone\nso long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\n\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the\noutskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds\nand damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on\nthe windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and\nwondering....\n\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for\nbreakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the\nhotel came over to their table.\n\n\"'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred\nof these at the front desk.\"\n\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nRoom 17\n\nRailview Hotel\n\nCokeworth\n\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out\nof the way. The woman stared.\n\n\"I'll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following\nher from the dining room.\n\nWouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested\ntimidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly\nwhat he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the\nmiddle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in\nthe car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle\nof a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of\na multilevel parking garage.\n\n\"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that\nafternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside\nthe car, and disappeared.\n\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley\nsniveled.\n\n\"It's Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto's on tonight. I\nwant to stay somewhere with a television. \"\n\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you\ncould usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of\ntelevision -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of\ncourse, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys\nhad given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.\nStill, you weren't eleven every day.\n\nUncle Vernon was back and he\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HARRY<|>PERSON<|>Harry is a young boy who is receiving numerous letters on the eve of his eleventh birthday, indicating he is a person of interest.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>PERSON<|>Uncle Vernon is Harry's uncle who is trying to prevent Harry from receiving letters and is acting erratically.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>PERSON<|>Aunt Petunia is Harry's aunt who is timid and concerned about Uncle Vernon's behavior.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUDLEY<|>PERSON<|>Dudley is Harry's cousin who is spoiled and complains about missing his television programs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAILVIEW HOTEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Railview Hotel is a gloomy-looking hotel where Harry and his family stay while trying to escape the letters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COKEWORTH<|>GEO<|>Cokeworth is the location of the Railview Hotel where Harry receives a letter addressed to him.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE GREAT HUMBERTO<|>EVENT<|>The Great Humberto is a television program that Dudley is eager to watch, indicating his interest in entertainment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIRTHDAY<|>EVENT<|>Harry's eleventh birthday is approaching, which is significant to him as he reflects on past birthdays.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>Uncle Vernon is trying to prevent Harry from receiving letters, indicating a conflict between them<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>DUDLEY<|>Dudley is Harry's cousin, and they share a familial relationship, though Dudley is often spoiled<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia are married and are Harry's guardians, showing a family relationship<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUDLEY<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>Dudley is Aunt Petunia's son, indicating a direct familial relationship<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>RAILVIEW HOTEL<|>Harry is staying at the Railview Hotel with his family while trying to escape the letters<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>COKEWORTH<|>Cokeworth is the location where Harry is staying at the Railview Hotel<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUDLEY<|>THE GREAT HUMBERTO<|>Dudley expresses his desire to watch The Great Humberto, showing his interest in the event<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>BIRTHDAY<|>Harry's eleventh birthday is significant to him, marking a personal milestone<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
