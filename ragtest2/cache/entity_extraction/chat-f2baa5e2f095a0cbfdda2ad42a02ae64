Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it\nproperly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly\nHeadless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said,\n\"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house\nchampionship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without\nwinning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody\nBaron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost.\"\n\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost\nsitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained\nwith silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to\nsee, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\n\n\"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest.\n\n\"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\n\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food\nfaded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment\nlater the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you\ncould think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam\ndoughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- \"\n\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their\nfamilies.\n\n\"I'm half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell\nhim she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock\nfor him.\"\n\nThe others laughed.\n\n\"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.\n\n\"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the\nfamily thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept\ntrying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he\npushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but\nnothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for\ndinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles\nwhen my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let\ngo. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They\nwere all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you\nshould have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might\nnot be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased\nhe bought me my toad.\"\n\nOn Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about\nlessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm\nparticularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something\ninto something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-\";\n\"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of\nthing -- \").\n\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at\n\nthe High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.\nProfessor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor\nQuirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy\nblack hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\n\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's\nturban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across\nthe scar on Harry's forehead.\n\n\"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Percy.\n\n\"N-nothing.\"\n\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the\nfeeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he\ndidn't like Harry at all.\n\n\"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy.\n\n\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so\nnervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want\nto -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about\nthe Dark Arts, Snape.\"\n\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.\n\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to\nhis feet again. The hall fell silent.\n\n\"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I\nhave a few start-of-term notices to give you.\n\n\"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to\nall pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember\nthat as well.\"\n\nDumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley\ntwins.\n\n\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all\nthat no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\n\n\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone\ninterested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\n\n\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor\non the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to\ndie a very painful death.\"\n\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\n\n\"He's not serious?\" he muttered to Percy.\n\n\"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It's odd, because he\nusually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the\nforest\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
