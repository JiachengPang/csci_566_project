In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.\nThe Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\n\n\"Do you mean ter tell me,\" he growled at the Dursleys, \"that this boy --\nthis boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?\"\n\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after\nall, and his marks weren't bad.\n\n\"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\" But\nHagrid simply waved his hand and said, \"About our world, I mean. Your\nworld. My world. Yer parents' world.\"\n\n\"What world?\"\n\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\n\n\"DURSLEY!\" he boomed.\n\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded\nlike \"Mimblewimble.\" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\n\n\"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they're\nfamous. You're famous.\"\n\n\"What? My -- my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?\"\n\n\"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know...\" Hagrid ran his fingers through his\nhair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\n\n\"Yeh don' know what yeh are?\" he said finally.\n\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\n\n\"Stop!\" he commanded. \"Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the\nboy anything!\"\n\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious\nlook Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled\nwith rage.\n\n\"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore\nleft fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An'\nyou've kept it from him all these years?\"\n\n\"Kept what from me?\" said Harry eagerly.\n\n\"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\n\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\n\n\"Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Harry -- yet a\nwizard.\"\n\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind\ncould be heard.\n\n\"-- a what?\" gasped Harry.\n\n\"A wizard, o' course,\" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which\ngroaned and sank even lower, \"an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once\nyeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else\nwould yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.\"\n\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,\naddressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock,\nThe Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf.

Please find enclosed a list of all\nnecessary books and equipment.\n\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\nYours sincerely,\n\nMinerva McGonagall,\n\nDeputy Headmistress\n\nQuestions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't\ndecide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does\nit mean, they await my owl?\"\n\n\"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to\nhis forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet\nanother pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live,\nrather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.\nWith his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could\nread upside down:\n\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\n\nGiven Harry his letter.\n\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\n\nWeather's horrible. Hope you're Well.\n\nHagrid\n\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its\nbeak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he\ncame back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the\ntelephone.\n\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\n\n\"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still\nashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\n\n\"He's not going,\" he said.\n\nHagrid grunted.\n\n\"I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\" he said.\n\n\"A what?\" said Harry, interested.\n\n\"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern.\nAn' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I\never laid eyes on.\"\n\n\"We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish,\" said\nUncle Vernon, \"swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\"\n\n\"You knew?\" said Harry. \"You knew I'm a -- a wizard?\"\n\n\"Knew!\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
