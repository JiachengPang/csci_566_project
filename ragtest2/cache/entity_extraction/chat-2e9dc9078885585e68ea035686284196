His\neyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth.\nThey were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\n\n\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of\npotionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but\nthey caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught\nevery word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a\nclass silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving\nhere, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you\nwill really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with\nits shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through\nhuman veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach\nyou how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't\nas big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"\n\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks\nwith raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and\nlooked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.\n\n\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered\nroot of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\"\n\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who\nlooked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.\n\n\"I don't know, sit,\" said Harry.\n\nSnape's lips curled into a sneer.\n\n\"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything.\"\n\nHe ignored Hermione's hand.\n\n\"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me\na bezoar?\"\n\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without\nher leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a\nbezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were\nshaking with laughter.\n\n\"I don't know, sit.\" \"Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming,\neh, Potter?\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those\ncold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did\nSnape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs\nand Fungi?\n\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.\n\n\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"\n\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\nceiling.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though, why\ndon't you try her?\"\n\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked.\nSnape, however, was not pleased.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter,\nasphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as\nthe Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach\nof a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and\nwolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of\naconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?\"\n\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise,\nSnape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your\ncheek, Potter.\"\n\nThings didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson\ncontinued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a\nsimple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak,\nwatching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing\nalmost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just\ntelling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned\nslugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the\ndungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a\ntwisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor,\nburning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was\nstanding on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the\npotion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils\nsprang up all over his arms and legs.\n\n\"Idiot boy!\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one\nwave of his wand. \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before\ntaking the cauldron off the fire?\"\n\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\n\n\"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he\nrounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\n\n\"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought\nhe'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another\npoint you've lost for Gryffindor.\"\n\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked\nhim behind their cauldron.\n\n\"Doi* push it,\" he muttered, \"I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.\"\n\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind\nwas racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor\nin his very first week -- why did\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
