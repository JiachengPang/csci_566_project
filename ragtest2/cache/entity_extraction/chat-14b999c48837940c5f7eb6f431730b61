We're going up\nto London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother.\"\n\n\"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things\nfriendly.\n\n\"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that\nruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\"\n\nHarry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and\nnervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because\nhe didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd\nchange on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure\nhe had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her\ncage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two\nhours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the\nDursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to\nHarry, and they had set off.\n\nThey reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's\ntrunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought\nthis was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the\nplatforms with a nasty grin on his face.\n\n\"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform\nshould be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it\nyet, do they?\"\n\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over\none platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and\nin the middle, nothing at all.\n\n\"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He\nleft without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.\nAll three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on\nearth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny\nlooks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone.\n\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and\nthree-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry\ncouldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to\nget annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting\ndesperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but\nthe guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away,\nmuttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.\nAccording to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes\nleft to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he\nwas stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly\nlift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\n\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like\ntapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He\nwondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket\ninspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.\n\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a\nfew words of what they were saying.\n\n\"-- packed with Muggles, of course --\"\n\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four\nboys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like\nHarry's in front of him -- and they had an owl.\n\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so\ndid he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\n\n\"Now, what's the platform number?\" said the boys' mother.\n\n\"Nine and three-quarters!\" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was\nholding her hand, \"Mom, can't I go... \"\n\n\"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go\nfirst.\"\n\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.\nHarry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as\nthe boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large\ncrowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last\nbackpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.\n\n\"Fred, you next,\" the plump woman said.\n\n\"I'm not Fred, I'm George,\" said the boy. \"Honestly, woman, you call\nyourself our mother? CarA you tell I'm George?\"\n\n\"Sorry, George, dear.\"\n\n\"Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went. His twin called\nafter him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later,\nhe had gone -- but how had he done it?\n\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was\nalmost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere.\n\nThere was nothing else for it.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman.\n\n\"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too.\"\n\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and\ngangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to\n--\"\n\n\"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\n\n\"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the\nbarrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
