Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing\nat two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.\n\n\"That's Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.\n\"He works at Hogwarts.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't\nhe?\"\n\n\"He's the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less\nevery second.\n\n\"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the\nschool grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,\nand ends up setting fire to his bed.\"\n\n\"I think he's brilliant,\" said Harry coldly.\n\n\"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you?

They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry\ncheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you\nwrote.

There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o'\nduffers, but --\"\n\n\"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff\" said Harry gloomily.\n\n\"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There's not a\nsingle witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.\nYou-Know-Who was one.\"\n\n\"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\"\n\n\"Years an' years ago,\" said Hagrid.\n\nThey bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts\nwhere the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as\npaving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in\ncovers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with\nnothing in them at all.
