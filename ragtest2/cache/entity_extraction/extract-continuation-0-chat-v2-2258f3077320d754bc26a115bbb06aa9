Now get back to bed, all\nof you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\"\n\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In\none night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house\ncup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How\ncould they ever make up for this?\n\nHarry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his\npillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to\nsay to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the\ndawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what\nthey'd done?\n\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the\nhouse points the next day thought there'd been a mistake. How could they\nsuddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then\nthe story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter,\ntheir hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points,\nhim and a couple of other stupid first years.\n\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school,\nHarry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs\nturned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose\nthe house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble\nto lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other\nhand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \"Thanks\nPotter, we owe you one!\"\n\nOnly Ron stood by him.\n\n\"They'll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads\nof points in all the time they've been here, and people still like\nthem.\"\n\n\"They've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have\nthey?\" said Harry miserably.\n\n\"Well -- no,\" Ron admitted.\n\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not\nto meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it\nwith sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he\nwent to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\n\n\"Resign?\" Wood thundered. \"What good'll that do? How are we going to get\nany points back if we can't win at Quidditch?\"\n\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak\nto Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they\ncalled him \"the Seeker.\"\n\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time\nas Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to\nthem, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in\nclass, keeping her head down and working in silence.\n\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying\nhe had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to\nthemselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the\ningredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart,\nmemorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....\n\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new\nresolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put\nto an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one\nafternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he\ndrew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice.\n\n\"No -- no -- not again, please --\"\n\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.\n\n\"All right -- all right --\" he heard Quirrell sob.\n\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening\nhis turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He\nstrode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him.\nHe waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into\nthe classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.\nHarry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised\nhimself about not meddling.\n\nAll the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had\njust left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be\nwalking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given\nin at last.\n\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\nAstronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard.\n\n\"Snape's done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell's told him how to break\nhis Anti-Dark Force spell --\"\n\n\"There's still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione.\n\n\"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\"\nsaid Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \"I bet\nthere's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant\nthree-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\"\n\nThe light of adventure was kindling again\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gryffindor is one of the four houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, known for bravery and courage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hogwarts is a magical school where young witches and wizards are educated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PERSON<|>Harry Potter is a famous student at Hogwarts, known for his achievements in Quidditch and his role in the wizarding world.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RON WEASLEY<|>PERSON<|>Ron Weasley is a close friend of Harry Potter and a fellow student at Hogwarts, known for his loyalty.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERMIONE GRANGER<|>PERSON<|>Hermione Granger is a highly intelligent student at Hogwarts and a close friend of Harry Potter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM<|>PERSON<|>Neville Longbottom is a student at Hogwarts who is known for his kind heart and struggles with confidence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIRRELL<|>PERSON<|>Professor Quirrell is a teacher at Hogwarts who is portrayed as timid and fearful.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNAPE<|>PERSON<|>Severus Snape is a professor at Hogwarts known for his complex character and association with dark magic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLYTHERIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slytherin is one of the four houses at Hogwarts, known for ambition and cunning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIDDITCH<|>EVENT<|>Quidditch is a popular sport played on broomsticks at Hogwarts, involving four balls and seven players on each team.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>Harry Potter is a member of Gryffindor house at Hogwarts, representing its values and competing in Quidditch.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON WEASLEY<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>Ron Weasley is a member of Gryffindor house and supports Harry during their time at Hogwarts.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMIONE GRANGER<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>Hermione Granger is a member of Gryffindor house and is a close friend of Harry and Ron.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>Neville Longbottom is a member of Gryffindor house and shares experiences with Harry and his friends.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIRRELL<|>SNAPE<|>Professor Quirrell is a colleague of Severus Snape at Hogwarts, and they are both involved in the events surrounding the Sorcerer's Stone.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>QUIDDITCH<|>Harry Potter is a prominent player on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, known for his skills as a Seeker.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>SLYTHERIN<|>Harry Potter's actions and reputation have a direct impact on the rivalry with Slytherin house, especially in Quidditch.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
