Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he\nwas joking.\"\n\nHarry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole\nschool? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have\nto do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.\nHe looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,\ntoo. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering\nvery fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one\nshe'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more\nnervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to\nthe Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He\nkept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall\nwould come back and lead him to his doom.\n\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air --\nseveral people behind him screamed.\n\n\"What the --?\"\n\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just\nstreamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent,\nthey glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing\nat the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat\nlittle monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him\na second chance --\"\n\n\"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He\ngives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- I\nsay, what are you all doing here?\"\n\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\n\nNobody answered.\n\n\"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be\nSorted, I suppose?\"\n\nA few people nodded mutely.\n\n\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony's about to\nstart.\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away\nthrough the opposite wall.\n\n\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and\nfollow me.\"\n\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line\nbehind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out\nof the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors\ninto the Great Hall.\n\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was\nlit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair\nover four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.\nThese tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the\ntop of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.\nProfessor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a\nhalt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.\nThe hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the\nflickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the\nghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry\nlooked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He\nheard\n\nHermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read\nabout it in Hogwarts, A History.\"\n\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the\nGreat Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.\n\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed\na four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she\nput a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and\nextremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.\n\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,\nthat seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was\nnow staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there\nwas complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened\nwide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:\n\n\"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,\n\nBut don't judge on what you see,\n\nI'll eat myself if you can find\n\nA smarter hat than me.\n\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\n\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\n\nFor I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n\nAnd I can cap them all.\n\nThere's nothing hidden in your head\n\nThe Sorting Hat can't see,\n\nSo try me on and I will tell you\n\nWhere you ought to be.\n\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\n\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\n\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;\n\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\n\nWhere they are just and loyal,\n\nThose patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;\n\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\n\nif you've a ready mind,\n\nWhere those of wit and learning,\n\nWill always find their kind;\n\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\n\nYou'll make your real friends,\n\nThose cunning folk use any means\n\nTo achieve their ends.\n\nSo put me on! Don't be afraid!\n\nAnd don't get in a flap!\n\nYou're in safe hands (though I have none)\n\nFor I'm a Thinking Cap!\"\n\nThe whole hall\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
