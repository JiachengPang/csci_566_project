D'you want the card, you\ncollect them, don't you?\"\n\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\n\n\"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever-\"\n\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron\nand Hermione.\n\n\"I've found him!\" he whispered. \"I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read\nthe name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen\nto this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark\nwizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of\ndragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas\nFlamel'!\"\n\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd\ngotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\n\n\"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls'\ndormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks\nbefore she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\n\n\"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this\nout of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\"\n\n\"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked\nsomething up, and started flicking frantically through the pages,\nmuttering to herself.\n\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\n\n\"I knew it! I knew it!\"\n\n\"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.\n\n\"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker\nof the Sorcerer's Stone!\"\n\nThis didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.\n\n\"The what?\" said Harry and Ron.\n\n\"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there.\"\n\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient\nstudy of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a\nlegendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform\nany metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which\nwill make the drinker immortal.\n\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries,\nbut the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel,\nthe noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six\nhundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon\nwith his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).\n\n\"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \"The dog must be\nguarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it\nsafe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it,\nthat's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\"\n\n\"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry. \"No\nwonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it.\"\n\n\"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent\nDevelopments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"He's not exactly recent if he's\nsix hundred and sixty-five, is he?\"\n\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down\ndifferent ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still\ndiscussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It\nwasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry\nremembered about Snape and the coming match.\n\n\"I'm going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don't, all the\nSlytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show\nthem... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\"\n\n\"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione.\n\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous,\nwhatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm,\neither. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was\nwonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed\nto, with such a biased referee?\n\nHarry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to\nkeep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered\nwhether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions\nlessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so\nhorrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the\nSorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had\nthe horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\n\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the\nnext afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever\nsee him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry\nhardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch\nrobes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to\nNeville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or\nwhy they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry\nknow that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker\nCurse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were\nready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\n\n\"Now, don\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
