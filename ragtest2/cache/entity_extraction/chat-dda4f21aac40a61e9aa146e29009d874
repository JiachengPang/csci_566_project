Step ping\ncarefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the\nlibrary, he held up his lamp to read the titles.\n\nThey didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\nwords in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all.\nOne book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The\nhairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it,\nmaybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books,\nas though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.\n\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\nhe looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large\nblack and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with\ndifficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee,\nlet it fall open.\n\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was\nscreaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one\nhigh, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over\nhis lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming\ndown the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the\nshelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild\neyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's\noutstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks\nstill ringing in his ears.\n\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been\nso busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where\nhe was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he\nwas at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he\nmust be five floors above there.\n\n\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\nwandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted\nSection.\"\n\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must\nknow a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and\nto his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well,\nthey can't be far, we'll catch them.\"\n\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\nahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor\nand if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak\ndidn't stop him from being solid.\n\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It\nwas his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying\nnot to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room\nwithout their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry\nleaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps\ndying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before\nhe noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\n\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs\nwere piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper\nbasket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that\ndidn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone\nhad just put it there to keep it out of the way.\n\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold\nframe, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved\naround the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic\nfading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved\nnearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection\nagain. He stepped in front of it.\n\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He\nwhirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the\nbook had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but\na whole crowd of people standing right behind him.\n\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to\nthe mirror.\n\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\nreflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his\nshoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible,\ntoo? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's\ntrick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\n\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his\nreflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt\nthe air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their\nreflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the\nothers existed only in the mirror.\n\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her\neyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the\nglass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that\nshe was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin,\nblack-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore\nglasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as\nHarry's\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
