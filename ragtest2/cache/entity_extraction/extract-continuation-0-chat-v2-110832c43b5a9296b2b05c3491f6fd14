If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed\nMrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening\ndown on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his\ncloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down\non the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he\nspoke to it.\n\n\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\n\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling\nat a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly\nthe shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was\nwearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight\nbun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n\n\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\n\n\"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\n\n\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\nProfessor McGonagall.\n\n\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\ndozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n\n\"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently.\n\"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles\nhave noticed something's going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her\nhead back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks\nof owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They\nwere bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet\nthat was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"\n\n\"You can't blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious\nlittle to celebrate for eleven years.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that's no\nreason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on\nthe streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,\nswapping rumors.\"\n\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping\nhe was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. \"A\nfine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have\ndisappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he\nreally has gone, Dumbledore?\"\n\n\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful\nfor. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't\nthink this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if\nYou-Know-Who has gone -\"\n\n\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him\nby his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I\nhave been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:\nVoldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was\nunsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so\nconfusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason\nto be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.\n\n\"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half\nexasperated, half admiring. \"But you're different. Everyone knows you're\nthe only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"\n\n\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will\nnever have.\"\n\n\"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them.\"\n\n\"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\ntold me she liked my new earmuffs.\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls\nare nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what\neveryone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally\nstopped him?\"\n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\nanxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard\nwall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed\nDumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that\nwhatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until\nDumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing\nanother lemon drop and did not answer.\n\n\"What they're saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort\nturned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is\nthat Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. \"\n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n\n\"Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it...\nOh, Albus...\"\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I\nknow...\" he said heavily.\n\nProfessor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. \"That's not all.\nThey're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he\ncouldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy.
