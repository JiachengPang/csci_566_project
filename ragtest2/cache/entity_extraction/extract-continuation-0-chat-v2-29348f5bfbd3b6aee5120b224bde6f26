Are\nyou ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\"\n\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\n\n\"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.\"\n\nHarry had a sudden idea.\n\n\"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own\nreasons for being invisible.\"\n\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time\nand hovered about a foot off the stairs.\n\n\"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\" he said greasily. \"My\nmistake, my mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're\ninvisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\"\n\n\"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this\nplace tonight.\"\n\n\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air\nagain. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you.\"\n\nAnd he scooted off\n\n\"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron.\n\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor\n-- and the door was already ajar.\n\n\"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape's already got past\nFluffy.\"\n\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\nwhat was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other\ntwo.\n\n\"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the\ncloak, I won't need it now.\"\n\n\"Don't be stupid,\" said Ron.\n\n\"We're coming,\" said Hermione.\n\nHarry pushed the door open.\n\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of\nthe dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it\ncouldn't see them.\n\n\"What's that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered.\n\n\"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\"\n\n\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here\ngoes...\"\n\nHe put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but\nfrom the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew\nbreath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and\nfell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\n\n\"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\ncrept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath\nas they approached the giant heads. \"I think we'll be able to pull the\ndoor open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog's back. \"Want to go first,\nHermione?\"\n\n\"No, I don't!\"\n\n\"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's\nlegs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and\nopen.\n\n\"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously.\n\n\"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just\nhave to drop.\"\n\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his\nattention and pointed at himself.\n\n\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don't know how deep\nthis thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\"\n\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog\ngrowled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell\nback into its deep sleep.\n\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no\nsign of the bottom.\n\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\nfingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to\nme, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\nDumbledore, right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Ron.\n\n\"See you in a minute, I hope...\n\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,\ndown and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on\nsomething soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the\ngloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.\n\n\"It's okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp,\nwhich was the open trapdoor, \"it's a soft landing, you can jump!\"\n\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\n\n\"What's this stuff?\" were his first words.\n\n\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall.\nCome on, Hermione!\"\n\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\nHermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.\n\n\"We must be miles under the school , she said.\n\n\"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\" said Ron.\n\n\"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\"\n\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\nbecause the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist\nsnakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\nher.
