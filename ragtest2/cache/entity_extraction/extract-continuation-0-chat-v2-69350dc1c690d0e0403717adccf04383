The rumor is\nthat Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. \"\n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n\n\"Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it...\nOh, Albus...\"\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I\nknow...\" he said heavily.\n\nProfessor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. \"That's not all.\nThey're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he\ncouldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,\nbut they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's\npower somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.\n\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n\n\"It's -- it's true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he's\ndone... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?\nIt's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the\nname of heaven did Harry survive?\"\n\n\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\neyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a\ngolden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.\nIt had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving\naround the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because\nhe put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid's late. I suppose it was\nhe who told you I'd be here, by the way?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don't suppose you're going to\ntell me why you're here, of all places?\"\n\n\"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family\nhe has left now.\"\n\n\"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?\" cried\nProfessor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.\n\"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't\nfind two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw\nhim kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.\nHarry Potter come and live here!\"\n\n\"It's the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and\nuncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've\nwritten them a letter.\"\n\n\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on\nthe wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a\nletter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a\nlegend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day\nin the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child\nin our world will know his name!\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his\nhalf-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous\nbefore he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even\nremember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away\nfrom all that until he's ready to take it?\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and\nthen said, \"Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy\ngetting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she\nthought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n\n\"Hagrid's bringing him.\"\n\n\"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as\nthis?\"\n\nI would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore.\n\n\"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,\" said Professor\nMcGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does\ntend to -- what was that?\"\n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew\nsteadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a\nheadlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and\na huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of\nthem.\n\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride\nit. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times\nas wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands\nthe size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were\nlike baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle\nof blankets.\n\n\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did\nyou get that motorcycle?\"\n\n\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,\" said the giant, climbing\ncarefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to\nme. I've got him, sir.\"\n\n\"No problems, were there?\"\n\n\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right\nbefore the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was\nflyin' over Bristol.\"\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\nblankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.
