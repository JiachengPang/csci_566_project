Slowly, very slowly, it raised\nits head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.\n\nIt winked.\n\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\nwatching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\n\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised\nits eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\n\n\"I get that all the time.\n\n\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the\nsnake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"\n\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\n\n\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.\n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry\npeered at it.\n\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\n\n\"Was it nice there?\"\n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:\nThis specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see -- so you've never been to\nBrazil?\"\n\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of\nthem jump.\n\n\"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE\nWHAT IT'S DOING!\"\n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\n\n\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by\nsurprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened\nso fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were\nleaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with\nhowls of horror.\n\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank\nhad vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering\nout onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and\nstarted running for the exits.\n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,\nhissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\"\n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\n\n\"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\"\n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea\nwhile he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only\ngibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except\nsnap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were\nall back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had\nnearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to\nsqueeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers\ncalming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you,\nHarry?\"\n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\nstarting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to\nsay, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a\nchair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He\ndidn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were\nasleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen\nfor some food.\n\nHe'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as\nlong as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents\nhad died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when\nhis parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long\nhours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding\nflash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he\nsupposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green\nlight came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and\nuncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask\nquestions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown\nrelation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\nDursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)\nthat strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers\nthey were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once\nwhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry\nfuriously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the\nshop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in\ngreen had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long\npurple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and\nthen walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these\npeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a\ncloser look.\n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated\nthat odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and\nnobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa con\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PERSON<|>Harry Potter is a young boy living with the Dursleys, who has a mysterious past and strange experiences with unusual people.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUDLEY DURSLEY<|>PERSON<|>Dudley Dursley is Harry Potter's cousin, known for his bullying behavior towards Harry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>PERSON<|>Uncle Vernon is Harry Potter's uncle, who is strict and often punishes Harry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>PERSON<|>Aunt Petunia is Harry Potter's aunt, who is dismissive of Harry and often scolds him.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOA CONSTRICTOR<|>EVENT<|>The boa constrictor is a snake at the zoo that Harry communicates with, leading to a dramatic escape.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZOO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The zoo is where Harry and the Dursleys visit, and where the boa constrictor is kept.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURSLEY FAMILY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Dursley family consists of Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, who are Harry's guardians.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>DUDLEY DURSLEY<|>Dudley Dursley bullies Harry Potter, making his life miserable at home and school.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>Uncle Vernon punishes Harry Potter and is strict with him, contributing to Harry's unhappy life.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>Aunt Petunia scolds Harry Potter and is dismissive of him, showing favoritism towards Dudley.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>BOA CONSTRICTOR<|>Harry Potter communicates with the boa constrictor at the zoo, which leads to the snake's escape.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUDLEY DURSLEY<|>DURSLEY FAMILY<|>Dudley Dursley is a member of the Dursley family, which includes Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>DURSLEY FAMILY<|>Uncle Vernon is the head of the Dursley family, responsible for Harry's upbringing.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>DURSLEY FAMILY<|>Aunt Petunia is a member of the Dursley family, married to Uncle Vernon and mother to Dudley.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZOO<|>DURSLEY FAMILY<|>The Dursley family visits the zoo, where significant events involving Harry and the boa constrictor occur.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
