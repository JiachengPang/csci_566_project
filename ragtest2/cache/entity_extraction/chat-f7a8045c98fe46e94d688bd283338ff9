'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair.\n\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it\nwhile Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a\nvideo camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and\na VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia\ncame back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\n\n\"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't\ntake him.\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction.\n\nDudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every\nyear on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the\nday, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every\nyear, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two\nstreets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage\nand Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever\nowned.\n\n\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd\nplanned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had\nbroken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be\na whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and\nTufty again.\n\n\"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested.\n\n\"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\"\n\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't\nthere -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't\nunderstand them, like a slug.\n\n\"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?\"\n\n\"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia.\n\n\"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to\nwatch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go\non Dudley's computer).\n\nAunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.\n\n\"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled.\n\n\"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening.\n\n\"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \"...\nand leave him in the car....\"\n\n\"That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone....\"\n\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had\nbeen years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up\nhis face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\n\n\"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special\nday!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him.\n\n\"I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge,\npretend sobs. \"He always sp- spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty\ngrin through the gap in his mother's arms.\n\nJust then, the doorbell rang -- \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt\nPetunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers\nPolkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face\nlike a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their\nbacks while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\n\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in\nthe back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the\nzoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able\nto think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle\nVernon had taken Harry aside.\n\n\"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up\nclose to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business,\nanything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until\nChristmas.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly..\n\nBut Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.\n\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was\njust no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.\n\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking\nas though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors\nand cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which\nshe left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly\nat Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day,\nwhere he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.\nNext morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it\nhad been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week\nin his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he\ncouldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.\n\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting\nold sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she\ntried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
