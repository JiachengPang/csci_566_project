He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down\n-- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\n-- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people\nwatching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he\ncaught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled\ngently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\n\n\"HARRY POTTER!\"\n\nHis heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was\nrunning toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\n\n\"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses\nflashed furiously, \"-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --\"\n\n\"It wasn't his fault, Professor --\"\n\n\"Be quiet, Miss Patil\n\n\"But Malfoy --\"\n\n\"That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\"\n\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he\nleft, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward\nthe castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to\nsay something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong\nwith his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even\nlooking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't\neven lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What\nwould the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\n\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor\nMcGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched\nalong corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was\ntaking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to\nstay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His\nstomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming\nwizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.\n\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door\nand poked her head inside.\n\n\"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\"\n\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on\nhim?\n\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out\nof Flitwicles class looking confused.\n\n\"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up\nthe corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\n\n\"In here.\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except\nfor Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\n\n\"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which\nclanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed\nthe door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\n\n\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I've found you a Seeker.\"\n\nWood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\n\n\"Are you serious, Professor?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy's a natural.\nI've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a\nbroomstick, Potter?\"\n\nHarry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he\ndidn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming\nback to his legs.\n\n\"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor\nMcGonagall told Wood. \"Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley\ncouldn't have done it.\"\n\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\n\n\"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly.\n\n\"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained.\n\n\"He's just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around\nHarry and staring at him. \"Light -- speedy -- we'll have to get him a\ndecent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven,\nI'd say.\"\n\nI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the\nfirst-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.\nFlattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape\nin the face for weeks....\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\n\n\"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind\nabout punishing you.\"\n\nThen she suddenly smiled.\n\n\"Your father would have been proud,\" she said. \"He was an excellent\nQuidditch player himself.\"\n\n\"You're joking.\"\n\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened\nwhen he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of\nsteak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about\nit.\n\n\"Seeker?\" he said. \"But first years never -- you must be the youngest\nhouse player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his\nmouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the\nafternoon. \"Wood told me.\"\n\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
