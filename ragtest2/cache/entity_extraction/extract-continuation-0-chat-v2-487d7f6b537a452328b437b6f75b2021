Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a\nnotice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.\nFlying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and\nSlytherin\twould be learning together.\n\n\"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool\nof myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\"\n\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\n\n\"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron\nreasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he\nis at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk.\"\n\nMalfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about\nfirst years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long,\nboastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping\nMuggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus\nFinnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the\ncountryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen\nabout the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom.\nEveryone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron\nhad already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their\ndormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game\nwith only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron\nprodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the\nplayers move.\n\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his\ngrandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had\ngood reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of\naccidents even with both feet on the ground.\n\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This\nwas something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she\nhadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with\nflying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through\nthe Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for\nanything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but\neverybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted\nby the arrival of the mail.\n\nHarry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that\nMalfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was\nalways bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened\ngloatingly at the Slytherin table.\n\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He\nopened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large\nmarble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\n\n\"It's a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things -- this\ntells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it\ntight like this and if it turns red -- oh...\" His face fell, because the\nRemembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet,\n\n\"You've forgotten something...\"\n\nNeville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy,\nwho was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his\nhand.\n\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason\nto fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble\nquicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\n\"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\n\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\n\n\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind\nhim.\n\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors\nhurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying\nlesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their\nfeet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn\non the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees\nwere swaying darkly in the distance.\n\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying\nin neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley\ncomplain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to\nvibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\n\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and\nyellow eyes like a hawk.\n\n\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a\nbroomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"\n\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck\nout at odd angles.\n\n\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the\nfront, \"and say 'Up!\"'\n\n\"UPF everyone shouted.\n\nHarry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few\nthat did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and\nNeville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell\nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's\nvoice that said only too clearly that he\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gryffindor is one of the four houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, known for bravery and courage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLYTHERIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slytherin is one of the four houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, known for ambition and cunning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hogwarts is a magical school where young witches and wizards are educated in various magical subjects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PERSON<|>Harry Potter is a young wizard and the protagonist of the series, known for his bravery and connection to the wizarding world.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RON WEASLEY<|>PERSON<|>Ron Weasley is Harry Potter's best friend and a member of the Weasley family, known for his loyalty and humor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRACO MALFOY<|>PERSON<|>Draco Malfoy is a student from Slytherin house, known for his rivalry with Harry Potter and his boastful nature.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM<|>PERSON<|>Neville Longbottom is a fellow Gryffindor student known for his clumsiness and eventual bravery.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERMIONE GRANGER<|>PERSON<|>Hermione Granger is one of Harry Potter's closest friends, known for her intelligence and diligence in studies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADAM HOOCH<|>PERSON<|>Madam Hooch is the flying instructor at Hogwarts, responsible for teaching students how to fly on broomsticks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REMEMBRALL<|>EVENT<|>A Remembrall is a magical object that indicates if a person has forgotten something, turning red when forgotten items are present.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>Harry Potter is a member of Gryffindor house at Hogwarts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON WEASLEY<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>Ron Weasley is a member of Gryffindor house at Hogwarts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMIONE GRANGER<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>Hermione Granger is a member of Gryffindor house at Hogwarts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>Neville Longbottom is a member of Gryffindor house at Hogwarts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRACO MALFOY<|>SLYTHERIN<|>Draco Malfoy is a member of Slytherin house at Hogwarts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>DRACO MALFOY<|>Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy have a rivalry at Hogwarts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON WEASLEY<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Ron Weasley is Harry Potter's best friend<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMIONE GRANGER<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Hermione Granger is one of Harry Potter's closest friends<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MADAM HOOCH<|>HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY<|>Madam Hooch is the flying instructor at Hogwarts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REMEMBRALL<|>NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM<|>Neville Longbottom received a Remembrall from his grandmother<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>MADAM HOOCH<|>Harry Potter is taught to fly by Madam Hooch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON WEASLEY<|>MADAM HOOCH<|>Ron Weasley is taught to fly by Madam Hooch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMIONE GRANGER<|>MADAM HOOCH<|>Hermione Granger is taught to fly by Madam Hooch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM<|>MADAM HOOCH<|>Neville Longbottom is taught to fly by Madam Hooch<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
