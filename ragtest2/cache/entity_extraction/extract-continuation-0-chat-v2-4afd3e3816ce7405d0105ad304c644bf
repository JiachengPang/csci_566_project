Strict and clever, she gave them a\ntalking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.\n\n\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you\nwill learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class\nwill leave and not come back. You have been warned.\"\n\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very\nimpressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they\nweren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.\nAfter taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match\nand started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson,\nonly Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor\nMcGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and\ngave Hermione a rare smile.\n\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense\nAgainst the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of\na joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said\nwas to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be\ncoming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had\nbeen given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of\na troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.\nFor one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell\nhad fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about\nthe weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung\naround the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed\nfull of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\n\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone\nelse. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't\nhad any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to\nlearn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.\n\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to\nfind their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost\nonce.\n\n\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his\nporridge.\n\n\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape's Head of\nSlytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see\nif it's true.\"\n\n\"Wish McGonagall favored us, \" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head\nof Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge\npile of homework the day before.\n\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but\nit had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a\nhundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,\ncircling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters\nand packages onto their laps.\n\nHedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to\nnibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the\nowlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered\ndown between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto\nHarry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy\nscrawl:\n\n\nDear Harry,\n\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have\na cup of tea with me around three?\n\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with\nHedwig.\n\nHagrid\n\n\nHarry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the\nback of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\n\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because\nthe Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to\nhim so far.\n\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor\nSnape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd\nbeen wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.\n\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder\nhere than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough\nwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\n\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and\nlike Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.\n\n\"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.\"\n\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their\nhands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His\neyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth.\nThey were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\n\n\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of\npotionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but\nthey caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught\nevery word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a\nclass silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving\nhere, many of you will hardly believe this is magic.
