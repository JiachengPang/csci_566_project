I didn't want to believe it...\nOh, Albus...\"\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I\nknow...\" he said heavily.\n\nProfessor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. \"That's not all.\nThey're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he\ncouldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,\nbut they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's\npower somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.\n\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n\n\"It's -- it's true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he's\ndone... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?\nIt's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the\nname of heaven did Harry survive?\"\n\n\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\neyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a\ngolden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.\nIt had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving\naround the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because\nhe put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid's late. I suppose it was\nhe who told you I'd be here, by the way?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don't suppose you're going to\ntell me why you're here, of all places?\"\n\n\"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family\nhe has left now.\"\n\n\"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?\" cried\nProfessor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.\n\"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't\nfind two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw\nhim kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.\nHarry Potter come and live here!\"\n\n\"It's the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and\nuncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've\nwritten them a letter.\"\n\n\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on\nthe wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a\nletter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a\nlegend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day\nin the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child\nin our world will know his name!\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his\nhalf-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous\nbefore he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even\nremember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away\nfrom all that until he's ready to take it?\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and\nthen said, \"Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy\ngetting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she\nthought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n\n\"Hagrid's bringing him.\"\n\n\"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as\nthis?\"\n\nI would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore.\n\n\"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,\" said Professor\nMcGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does\ntend to -- what was that?\"\n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew\nsteadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a\nheadlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and\na huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of\nthem.\n\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride\nit. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times\nas wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands\nthe size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were\nlike baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle\nof blankets.\n\n\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did\nyou get that motorcycle?\"\n\n\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,\" said the giant, climbing\ncarefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to\nme. I've got him, sir.\"\n\n\"No problems, were there?\"\n\n\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right\nbefore the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was\nflyin' over Bristol.\"\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\nblankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a\ntuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously\nshaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n\n\"Is that where -?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He'll have that scar forever.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<|>PERSON<|>Albus Dumbledore is a prominent wizard and headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, known for his wisdom and leadership in the wizarding world.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL<|>PERSON<|>Professor McGonagall is a professor at Hogwarts and Deputy Headmistress, known for her strict demeanor and deep care for her students.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PERSON<|>Harry Potter is a young wizard and the protagonist of the series, known for surviving an attack by the dark wizard Voldemort as a baby.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLDEMORT<|>PERSON<|>Voldemort is a dark wizard and the main antagonist of the series, known for his quest for power and immortality, and for attempting to kill Harry Potter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAGRID<|>PERSON<|>Rubeus Hagrid is the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts, known for his giant stature and love for magical creatures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIRIUS BLACK<|>PERSON<|>Sirius Black is a wizard and Harry Potter's godfather, known for his loyalty and rebellious spirit against the dark forces.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hogwarts is a magical school for young witches and wizards, known for its four houses and rich history in the wizarding world.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUGGLES<|>PERSON<|>Muggles are non-magical people in the wizarding world, often unaware of the existence of magic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Bristol<|>GEO<|>Bristol is a city in England, mentioned as a location where Hagrid flew over while bringing Harry Potter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIGHTNING SCAR<|>EVENT<|>The lightning scar is a distinctive mark on Harry Potter's forehead, a result of Voldemort's failed attempt to kill him as a baby.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Dumbledore is a mentor and protector of Harry Potter, guiding him in the wizarding world<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Professor McGonagall cares for Harry Potter and is concerned about his upbringing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOLDEMORT<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Voldemort is the dark wizard who attempted to kill Harry Potter as a baby, marking him as his enemy<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAGRID<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Hagrid is responsible for bringing Harry Potter to his aunt and uncle, playing a crucial role in his early life<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIRIUS BLACK<|>HAGRID<|>Sirius Black lent Hagrid the motorcycle to bring Harry Potter, indicating their close friendship<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<|>HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY<|>Dumbledore is the headmaster of Hogwarts, overseeing the education of young witches and wizards<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL<|>HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY<|>Professor McGonagall is a professor at Hogwarts, contributing to the education and welfare of students<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAGRID<|>HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY<|>Hagrid works at Hogwarts as the Keeper of Keys and Grounds, playing a vital role in the school's operations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOLDEMORT<|>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<|>Dumbledore is one of Voldemort's main adversaries, representing the fight against dark magic<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>LIGHTNING SCAR<|>Harry Potter's lightning scar is a symbol of his survival against Voldemort's attack, marking him as a significant figure in the wizarding world<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
