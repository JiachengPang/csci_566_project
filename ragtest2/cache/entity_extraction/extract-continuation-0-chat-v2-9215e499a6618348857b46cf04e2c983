A foolish young man I was then, full of\nridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong\nI was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too\nweak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I\nhave let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\"\nQuirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I\nfailed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He\npunished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me....\"\n\nQuirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon\nAlley -how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that\nvery day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\n\n\"I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break\nit?\"\n\nHarry's mind was racing.\n\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he\nthought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the\nmirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I'll see where\nit's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up\nto?\n\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without\nQuirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he\ntripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to\nhimself. \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\"\n\nAnd to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come\nfrom Quirrell himself\n\n\"Use the boy... Use the boy...\"\n\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\n\n\"Yes -- Potter -- come here.\"\n\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry\ngot slowly to his feet.\n\n\"Come here,\" Quirrell repeated. \"Look in the mirror and tell me what you\nsee.\"\n\nHarry walked toward him.\n\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I\nsee, that's all.\n\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that\nseemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in\nfront of the mirror, and opened them again.\n\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment\nlater, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and\npulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its\npocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his\nreal pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone.\n\n\"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\"\n\nHarry screwed up his courage.\n\n\"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I -- I've\nwon the house cup for Gryffindor.\"\n\nQuirrell cursed again.\n\n\"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the\nSorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\n\nBut he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though\nQuirrell wasn't moving his lips.\n\n\"He lies... He lies...\"\n\n\"Potter, come back here!\" Quirrell shouted. \"Tell me the truth! What did\nyou just see?\"\n\nThe high voice spoke again.\n\n\"Let me speak to him... face-to-face...\"\n\n\"Master, you are not strong enough!\"\n\n\"I have strength enough... for this....\"\n\nHarry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't\nmove a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to\nunwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's\nhead looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the\nspot.\n\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there\nshould have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most\nterrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red\neyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\n\n\"Harry Potter...\" it whispered.\n\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.\n\n\"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor ... I\nhave form only when I can share another's body... but there have always\nbeen those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn\nblood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell\ndrinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life,\nI will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don't you give\nme that Stone in your pocket?\"\n\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He\nstumbled backward.\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join\nme... or you'll meet the same end as\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>QUIRRELL<|>PERSON<|>Quirrell is a character who serves Lord Voldemort and struggles with his master's instructions, showing signs of fear and weakness in his loyalty to Voldemort.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PERSON<|>Harry Potter is the protagonist who is trying to find the Sorcerer's Stone and is confronted by Quirrell and Voldemort.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LORD VOLDEMORT<|>PERSON<|>Lord Voldemort is the dark wizard who has possessed Quirrell and seeks the Sorcerer's Stone to regain his physical form.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SORCERER'S STONE<|>EVENT<|>The Sorcerer's Stone is a magical object that grants immortality and is the object of desire for Voldemort.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gryffindor is one of the four houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, known for bravery and courage.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIRRELL<|>LORD VOLDEMORT<|>Quirrell serves Lord Voldemort and is influenced by him, showing a master-servant relationship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>QUIRRELL<|>Harry Potter confronts Quirrell in an attempt to protect the Sorcerer's Stone<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>LORD VOLDEMORT<|>Harry Potter is directly confronted by Voldemort, who seeks the Sorcerer's Stone<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LORD VOLDEMORT<|>SORCERER'S STONE<|>Voldemort desires the Sorcerer's Stone to regain his physical form and immortality<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>GRYFFINDOR<|>Harry Potter is a member of Gryffindor house, which he represents during his time at Hogwarts<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
