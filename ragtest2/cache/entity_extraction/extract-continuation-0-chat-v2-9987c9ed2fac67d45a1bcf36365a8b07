And cleverness! There are more important\nthings -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!\"\n\n\"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle\nat the end, and shuddered.\n\n\"It's not poison?\" said Harry anxiously.\n\n\"No -- but it's like ice.\"\n\n\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\"\n\n\"Good luck -- take care.\"\n\n\"GO!\"\n\nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\n\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to\nface the black flames.\n\n\"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\n\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle\ndown and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking\nhis body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing\nbut dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\n\nThere was already someone there -- but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even\nVoldemort.\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES\n\nIt was Quirrell.\n\n\"You!\" gasped Harry.\n\nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all.\n\n\"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here,\nPotter.\"\n\n\"But I thought -- Snape --\"\n\n\"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble,\neither, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't\nhe? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to\nhim, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\"\n\nHarry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't.\n\n\"But Snape tried to kill me!\"\n\n\"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally\nknocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch\nmatch. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd\nhave got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape\nhadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\"\n\n\"Snape was trying to save me?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"\\Why do you think he wanted to\nreferee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it\nagain. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything\nwith Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was\ntrying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular...\nand what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you\ntonight.\"\n\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped\nthemselves tightly around Harry.\n\n\"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on\nHalloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what\nwas guarding the Stone.\"\n\n\"You let the troll in?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what\nI did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while\neveryone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already\nsuspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not\nonly did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog\ndidn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly.\n\n\"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\n\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.\nIt was the Mirror of Erised.\n\n\"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured,\ntapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with\nsomething like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away by the\ntime he gets back....\"\n\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\nfrom concentrating on the mirror.\n\n\"I saw you and Snape in the forest --\" he blurted out.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the\nback. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got.\nHe suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could,\nwhen I had Lord Voldemort on my side....\"\n\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into\nit.\n\n\"I see the Stone... I'm presenting it to my master... but where is it?\"\n\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He\nhad to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\n\n\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\"\n\n\"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts\nwith your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never\nwanted you dead.\"\n\n\"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was\nthreatening you....\"\n\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master's instructions\n-- he is a great wizard and I am weak --\"\n\n\"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HARRY<|>PERSON<|>Harry is a central character in the story, known for his bravery and friendship, and is involved in a confrontation with Quirrell.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERMIONE<|>PERSON<|>Hermione is a close friend of Harry, known for her intelligence and cleverness, and plays a significant role in the events surrounding the Stone.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIRRELL<|>PERSON<|>Quirrell is a character who reveals his intentions to harm Harry and is associated with dark magic and Lord Voldemort.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNAPE<|>PERSON<|>Severus Snape is a teacher at Hogwarts who is suspected of malevolent intentions but is revealed to have been trying to protect Harry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUMBLEDORE<|>PERSON<|>Dumbledore is the headmaster of Hogwarts, known for his wisdom and powerful magic, and is mentioned as being in London during the events.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLDERMORT<|>PERSON<|>Voldemort is a dark wizard and the main antagonist, whose presence is felt through Quirrell's actions and intentions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIRROR OF ERISED<|<EVENT<|>The Mirror of Erised is a magical object that reveals the deepest desires of a person's heart, playing a crucial role in the search for the Stone.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>QUIRRELL<|>Harry confronts Quirrell, who reveals his intentions to kill him and his connection to Voldemort<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMIONE<|>HARRY<|>Hermione expresses concern for Harry's safety and encourages him to be careful<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIRRELL<|>SNAPE<|>Quirrell discusses Snape's role in trying to protect Harry, indicating a complex relationship between them<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNAPE<|>HARRY<|>Snape is revealed to have been trying to protect Harry during the Quidditch match<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUMBLEDORE<|>QUIRRELL<|>Dumbledore is mentioned as being in London, which affects Quirrell's plans<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIRRELL<|>VOLDERMORT<|>Quirrell is acting on behalf of Voldemort, indicating a direct relationship between them<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>MIRROR OF ERISED<|>Harry interacts with the Mirror of Erised, which is key to finding the Stone<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
