His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made\nthe first noise of the day.\n\n\"Up! Get up! Now!\"\n\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\n\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then\nthe sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his\nback and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a\ngood one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny\nfeeling he'd had the same dream before.\n\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\n\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Nearly,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you\ndare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\"\n\nHarry groaned.\n\n\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing...\"\n\nDudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out\nof bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and,\nafter pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to\nspiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and\nthat was where he slept.\n\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table\nwas almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as\nthough Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the\nsecond television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a\nracing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated\nexercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's\nfavorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry\ndidn't look it, but he was very fast.\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry\nhad always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and\nskinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes\nof Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry\nhad a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He\nwore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of\nall the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry\nliked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that\nwas shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could\nremember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt\nPetunia was how he had gotten it.\n\n\"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask\nquestions.\"\n\nDon't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the\nDursleys.\n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\n\n\"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\n\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and\nshouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts\nthan the rest of the boys in his class put\n\ntogether, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way --\nall over the place.\n\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\nmother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face,\nnot much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay\nsmoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley\nlooked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a\npig in a wig.\n\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult\nas there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.\nHis face fell.\n\n\"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two\nless than last year.\"\n\n\"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here\nunder this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\"\n\n\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face.\nHarry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down\nhis bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\n\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,\n\"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's\nthat, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right''\n\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said\nslowly, \"So I'll have thirty ... thirty...\"\n\n\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia.\n\n\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right\nthen.\"\n\nUncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like\nhis father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair.\n\nAt that moment the telephone\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
