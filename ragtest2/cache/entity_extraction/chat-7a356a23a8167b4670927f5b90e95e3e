He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it\neasily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a\nlittle. He turned to look at them all.\n\n\"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy\njourney...\"\n\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\n\n\"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger.\n\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,\nterrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\n\n\"An' here's Harry!\" said the giant.\n\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the\nbeetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\n\n\"Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look a\nlot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes.\"\n\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\n\nI demand that you leave at once, sit!\" he said. \"You are breaking and\nentering!\"\n\n\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over\nthe back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent\nit into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it\ninto a corner of the room.\n\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\n\n\"Anyway -- Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a\nvery happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on\nit at some point, but it'll taste all right.\"\n\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly\nsquashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a\nlarge, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in\ngreen icing.\n\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words\ngot lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are\nyou?\"\n\nThe giant chuckled.\n\n\"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and\nGrounds at Hogwarts.\"\n\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.\n\n\"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together.\n\"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind.\"\n\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and\nhe snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he\nwas doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire\nthere. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt\nthe warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.\n\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and\nbegan taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a\ncopper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several\nchipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from\nbefore starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and\nsmell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was\nworking, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt\nsausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said\nsharply, \"Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\"\n\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\n\n\"Yet great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don'\nworry.\"\n\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted\nanything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the\ngiant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said,\n\"I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are.\"\n\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his\nhand.\n\n\"Call me Hagrid,\" he said, \"everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm\nKeeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.\n\n\"Er -- no,\" said Harry.\n\nHagrid looked shocked.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Harry said quickly.\n\n\"Sony?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back\ninto the shadows. \"It' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't\ngettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou'\nHogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents\nlearned it all?\"\n\n\"All what?\" asked Harry.\n\n\"ALL WHAT?\" Hagrid thundered. \"Now wait jus' one second!\"\n\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.\nThe Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\n\n\"Do you mean ter tell me,\" he growled at the Dursleys, \"that this boy --\nthis boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?\"\n\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after\nall, and his marks weren't bad.\n\n\"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\" But\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
