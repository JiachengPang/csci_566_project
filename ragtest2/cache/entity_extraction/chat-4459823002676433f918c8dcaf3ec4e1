Harry's\nseemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.\nWhat was going on? Where were the others?\n\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy,\nNeville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed,\nhad sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had\npanicked and sent up the sparks.\n\n\"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were\nmakin'. Right, we're changin' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an'\nHermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry,\" Hagrid\nadded in a whisper to Harry, \"but he'll have a harder time frightenin'\nyou, an' we've gotta get this done.\"\n\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They\nwalked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until\nthe path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so\nthick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were\nsplashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been\nthrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead,\nthrough the tangled branches of an ancient oak.\n\n\"Look --\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\n\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\n\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\nanything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at\nodd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on\nthe dark leaves.\n\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\nfreeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered....\nThen, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the\nground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood\ntransfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head\nover the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.\n\n\"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\"\n\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded\nfigure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was\ndribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward\nHarry -- he couldn't move for fear.\n\nThen a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as\nthough his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He\nheard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over\nHarry, charging at the figure.\n\nThe pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a\nminute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur\nwas standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he\nhad white-blond hair and a palomino body.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\n\n\"Yes -- thank you -- what was that?\"\n\nThe centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\nsapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar\nthat stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.\n\n\"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Hagrid.\nThe forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride?\nIt will be quicker this way.\n\n\"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\nlegs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\n\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\nclearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks\nheaving and sweaty.\n\n\"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your\nback! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"\n\n\"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The\nquicker he leaves this forest, the better.\"\n\n\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we\nare sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read\nwhat is to come in the movements of the planets?\"\n\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \"I'm sure Firenze thought he was\nacting for the best, \" he said in his gloomy voice.\n\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\n\n\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with\nwhat has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like\ndonkeys after stray humans in our forest!\"\n\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had\nto grab his shoulders to stay on.\n\n\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not\nunderstand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that\nsecret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes,\nwith humans alongside me if I must.\"\n\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\nthey plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\n\nHarry didn't have a clue what was going on.\n\n\"Why's Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
