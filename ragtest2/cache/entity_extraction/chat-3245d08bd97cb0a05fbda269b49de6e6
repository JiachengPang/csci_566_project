I've got him, sir.\"\n\n\"No problems, were there?\"\n\n\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right\nbefore the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was\nflyin' over Bristol.\"\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\nblankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a\ntuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously\nshaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n\n\"Is that where -?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He'll have that scar forever.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"\n\n\"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself\nabove my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well\n-- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with.\"\n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.\n\n\"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his\ngreat, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\nscratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a\nwounded dog.\n\n\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you'll wake the Muggles!\"\n\n\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and\nburying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead\n-- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or\nwe'll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly\non the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to\nthe front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out\nof his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to\nthe other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at\nthe little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall\nblinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from\nDumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.\n\n\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that's that. We've no business staying\nhere. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I'll be takin' Sirius his\nbike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"\n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself\nonto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose\ninto the air and off into the night.\n\n\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore,\nnodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he\nstopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and\ntwelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet\nDrive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking\naround the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the\nbundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n\n\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish\nof his cloak, he was gone.\n\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and\ntidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect\nastonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his\nblankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside\nhim and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was\nfamous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.\nDursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk\nbottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and\npinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very\nmoment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up\ntheir glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy\nwho lived!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find\ntheir nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at\nall. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass\nnumber four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living\nroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when\nMr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.\nTen years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large\nblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a\ncomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.\nThe room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\n\nYet Harry Potter\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
