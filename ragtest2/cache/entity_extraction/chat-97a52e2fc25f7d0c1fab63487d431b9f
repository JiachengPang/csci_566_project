Hagrid almost had to drag\nHarry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and\nBefuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs,\nTongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\n\n\"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\"\n\n\"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the\nMuggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid. \"An'\nanyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more\nstudy before yeh get ter that level.\"\n\nHagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says\npewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing\npotion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited\nthe Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible\nsmell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff\nstood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined\nthe walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung\nfrom the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a\nsupply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself\nexamined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule,\nglittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\n\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.\n\n\"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday\npresent.\"\n\nHarry felt himself go red.\n\n\"You don't have to --\"\n\n\"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad,\ntoads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don'\nlike cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want\nowls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been\ndark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now\ncarried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with\nher head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks,\nsounding just like Professor Quirrell.\n\n\"Don' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don' expect you've had a lotta\npresents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer\nwands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\"\n\nA magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\n\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door\nread Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay\non a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\n\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped\ninside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair\nthat Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had\nentered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that\nhad just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow\nboxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of\nhis neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle\nwith some secret magic.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have\njumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly\noff the spindly chair.\n\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like\nmoons through the gloom of the shop.\n\n\"Hello,\" said Harry awkwardly.\n\n\"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon.\nHarry Potter.\" It wasn't a question. \"You have your mother's eyes. It\nseems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten\nand a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm\nwork.\"\n\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those\nsilvery eyes were a bit creepy.\n\n\"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches.\nPliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I\nsay your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the\nwizard, of course.\"\n\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to\nnose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\n\n\"And that's where...\"\n\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a\nlong, white finger.\n\n\"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly.\n\"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in\nthe wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into\nthe world to do....\"\n\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.\n\n\"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again....
