I do think he\nmight have told us prefects, at least.\"\n\n\"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried\nDumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become\nrather fixed.\n\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a\nfly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose\nhigh above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\n\n\"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\"\nAnd the school bellowed:\n\n\"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\n\nTeach us something please,\n\nWhether we be old and bald\n\nOr young with scabby knees,\n\nOur heads could do with filling\n\nWith some interesting stuff,\n\nFor now they're bare and full of air,\n\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\n\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\n\nBring back what we've forgot,\n\njust do your best, we'll do the rest,\n\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.\n\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the\nWeasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.\nDumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they\nhad finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\n\n\"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here!\nAnd now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"\n\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds,\nout of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were\nlike lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He\nwas too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits\nalong the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice\nPercy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging\ntapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their\nfeet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when\nthey came to a sudden halt.\n\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as\nPercy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\n\n\"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised\nhis voice, \"Peeves -- show yourself\"\n\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\n\n\"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"\n\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide\nmouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking\nsticks.\n\n\"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\"\n\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\n\n\"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked\nPercy.\n\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on\nNeville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as\nhe passed.\n\n\"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again.\n\"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even\nlisten to us prefects. Here we are.\"\n\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a\npink silk dress.\n\n\"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait\nswung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled\nthrough it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the\nGryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\n\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the\nboys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were\nobviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five\nfour-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had\nalready been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their\npajamas and fell into bed.\n\n\" Great food, isn't it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.\n\"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets.\"\n\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he\nfell asleep almost at once.\n\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange\ndream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to\nhim, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was\nhis destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it\ngot heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened\npainfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with\nit -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh\nbecame high and cold -- there was a burst of green light\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
