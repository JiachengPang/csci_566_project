Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened\nwhen he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of\nsteak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about\nit.\n\n\"Seeker?\" he said. \"But first years never -- you must be the youngest\nhouse player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his\nmouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the\nafternoon. \"Wood told me.\"\n\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\n\n\"I start training next week,\" said Harry. \"Only don't tell anyone, Wood\nwants to keep it a secret.\"\n\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and\nhurried over.\n\n\"Well done,\" said George in a low voice. \"Wood told us. We're on the\nteam too -- Beaters.\"\n\n\"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\"\nsaid Fred. \"We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is\ngoing to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping\nwhen he told us.\"\n\n\"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret\npassageway out of the school.\"\n\n\"Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found\nin our first week. See you.\"\n\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome\nturned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the\nMuggles?\"\n\n\"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got\nyour little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly. There was of course\nnothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was\nfull of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their\nknuckles and scowl.\n\n\"I'd take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy. \"Tonight, if you want.\nWizard's duel. Wands only -- no contact. What's the matter? Never heard\nof a wizard's duel before, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around. \"I'm his second, who's\nyours?\"\n\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\n\n\"Crabbe,\" he said. \"Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy\nroom; that's always unlocked.\"\n\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \"What is a\nwizard's duel?\" said Harry. \"And what do you mean, you're my second?\"\n\n\"Well, a second's there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually,\ngetting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's\nface, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know,\nwith real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send\nsparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real\ndamage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\"\n\n\"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\"\n\n\"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested. \"Excuse me.\"\n\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\n\n\"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?\" said Ron.\n\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\n\n\"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --\"\n\n\"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered.\n\n\"--and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the\npoints you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be.\nIt's really very selfish of you.\"\n\n\"And it's really none of your business,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Ron.\n\nAll the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day,\nHarry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus\nfalling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had\nspent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you,\nyou'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them.\"\nThere was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or\nMrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another\nschool rule today. On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept looming\nup out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy\nface-to-face. He couldn't miss it.\n\n\"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we'd better go.\"\n\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across\nthe tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor\ncommon room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning\nall the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached\nthe portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I\ncan't believe you're going to do this, Harry.\"\n\nA lamp flickered on.
