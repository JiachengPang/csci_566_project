This aversion creates a hostile environment for Harry, who struggles to reconcile his identity with the Dursleys' expectations. Their refusal to acknowledge Harry's significance in the magical world contributes to the ongoing conflict and tension within the family [Data: Relationships (35, 58, 361)].\n\n## The Dursleys' neglectful guardianship\n\nDespite being Harry's guardians, the Dursleys are depicted as neglectful and antagonistic towards him.
