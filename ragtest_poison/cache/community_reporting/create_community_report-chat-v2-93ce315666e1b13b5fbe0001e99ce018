This relationship is marked by neglect and hostility, as Uncle Vernon frequently punishes Harry for perceived misbehavior and attempts to suppress his magical identity. The dynamic between them illustrates the broader theme of familial control and the impact of an unsympathetic guardian on a child's development. Uncle Vernon's actions, such as trying to prevent Harry from receiving letters from Hogwarts, further emphasize his desire to control Harry's life and limit his exposure to the magical world.

This favoritism starkly contrasts with the neglect Harry experiences, highlighting the dysfunctional family dynamics at play. Uncle Vernon's support for Dudley often comes at the expense of Harry, as he frequently threatens Harry to ensure Dudley gets what he wants. This favoritism not only fosters a sense of entitlement in Dudley but also exacerbates Harry's feelings of isolation and inadequacy within the family unit.

This conflict is evident when Hagrid confronts Uncle Vernon about Harry's right to attend Hogwarts, showcasing the tension between the two worlds. Uncle Vernon's vehement opposition to Harry's magical heritage reflects his desire to maintain control over Harry's life and suppress any connection to magic. This ongoing conflict not only highlights Uncle Vernon's character but also serves as a broader commentary on the challenges faced by those who exist between two worlds, particularly for Harry, who is caught in the middle of this struggle [Data: Relationships (439)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"The role of Aunt Petunia\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Aunt Petunia, as Uncle Vernon's wife, shares in the responsibility of raising Harry, albeit in a similarly neglectful manner.

While Aunt Petunia's role is often overshadowed by Uncle Vernon's more aggressive demeanor, her complicity in the family's treatment of Harry contributes to the overall atmosphere of hostility and neglect.

The forest, in particular, represents both danger and exploration, contrasting with Uncle Vernon's fear-driven actions.
