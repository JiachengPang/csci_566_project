Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley\nsniveled.\n\n\"It's Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto's on tonight. I\nwant to stay somewhere with a television. \"\n\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you\ncould usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of\ntelevision -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of\ncourse, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys\nhad given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.\nStill, you weren't eleven every day.\n\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,\nthin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd\nbought.\n\n\"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\"\n\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\nlooked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was\nthe most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was\ncertain, there was no television in there.\n\n\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his\nhands together. \"And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his\nboat!\"\n\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather\nwicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below\nthem.\n\n\"I've already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\"\n\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their\nnecks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like\nhours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding,\nled the way to the broken-down house.\n\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind\nwhistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was\ndamp and empty. There were only two rooms.\n\nUncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\nbananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked\nand shriveled up.\n\n\"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully.\n\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance\nof reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately\nagreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.\n\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the\nhigh waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the\nfilthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second\nroom and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle\nVernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find\nthe softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,\nmost ragged blanket.\n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry\ncouldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable,\nhis stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the\nlow rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of\nDudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat\nwrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and\nwatched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would\nremember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\n\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the\nroof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.\nFour minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of\nletters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.\n\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like\nthat? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was\nthe rock crumbling into the sea?\n\nOne minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...\nnine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two...\none...\n\nBOOM.\n\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the\ndoor. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\n\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \"Where's the cannon?\" he\nsaid stupidly.\n\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the\nroom. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been\nin the long, thin package he had brought with them.\n\n\"Who's there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you -- I'm armed!\"\n\nThere was a pause. Then --\n\nSMASH!\n\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and\nwith a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\n\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost\ncompletely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled\nbeard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles\nunder all the hair.\n\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just\nbrushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it\neasily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
