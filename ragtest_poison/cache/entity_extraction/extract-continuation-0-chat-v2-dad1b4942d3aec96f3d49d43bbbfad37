It was worse than having a cupboard as a\nbedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door\nto wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised\nits head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.\n\nIt winked.\n\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\nwatching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\n\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised\nits eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\n\n\"I get that all the time.\n\n\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the\nsnake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"\n\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\n\n\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.\n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry\npeered at it.\n\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\n\n\"Was it nice there?\"\n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:\nThis specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see -- so you've never been to\nBrazil?\"\n\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of\nthem jump.\n\n\"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE\nWHAT IT'S DOING!\"\n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\n\n\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by\nsurprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened\nso fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were\nleaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with\nhowls of horror.\n\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank\nhad vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering\nout onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and\nstarted running for the exits.\n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,\nhissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\"\n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\n\n\"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\"\n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea\nwhile he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only\ngibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except\nsnap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were\nall back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had\nnearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to\nsqueeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers\ncalming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you,\nHarry?\"\n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\nstarting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to\nsay, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a\nchair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He\ndidn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were\nasleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen\nfor some food.\n\nHe'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as\nlong as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents\nhad died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when\nhis parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long\nhours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding\nflash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he\nsupposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green\nlight came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and\nuncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask\nquestions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown\nrelation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\nDursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)\nthat strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers\nthey were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once\nwhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry\nfuriously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the\nshop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in\ngreen had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long\npurple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and\nthen walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these\npeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a\ncloser look.\n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HARRY<|>PERSON<|>Harry is a young boy who has lived with the Dursleys for almost ten years and has a mysterious past related to his parents' death in a car crash.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURSLEYS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Dursleys are Harry's aunt and uncle, who have raised him since he was a baby and treat him poorly.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>PERSON<|>Aunt Petunia is Harry's aunt, who is married to Uncle Vernon and is responsible for his care.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>PERSON<|>Uncle Vernon is Harry's uncle, who is often angry with Harry and punishes him.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUDLEY<|>PERSON<|>Dudley is Harry's cousin, who bullies him and is favored by the Dursleys.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOA CONSTRICTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The boa constrictor is a snake in the reptile house that Harry interacts with, which has a sign indicating it is from Brazil.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPTILE HOUSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The reptile house is a section of the zoo where Harry and the Dursleys visit, featuring various reptiles including the boa constrictor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL<|>GEO<|>Brazil is the country where the boa constrictor is originally from, as indicated by the sign next to its tank.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>DURSLEYS<|>Harry is raised by the Dursleys, who are his guardians but treat him poorly<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>DURSLEYS<|>Aunt Petunia is a member of the Dursley family and is responsible for Harry's care<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>DURSLEYS<|>Uncle Vernon is a member of the Dursley family and is responsible for Harry's care<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUDLEY<|>DURSLEYS<|>Dudley is a member of the Dursley family and is favored by them<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>AUNT PETUNIA<|>Harry is the nephew of Aunt Petunia, who is responsible for his upbringing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>UNCLE VERNON<|>Harry is the nephew of Uncle Vernon, who often punishes him<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>DUDLEY<|>Dudley bullies Harry and is favored by the Dursleys<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>BOA CONSTRICTOR<|>Harry interacts with the boa constrictor in the reptile house, establishing a connection<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOA CONSTRICTOR<|>BRAZIL<|>The boa constrictor is originally from Brazil, as indicated by the sign next to its tank<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REPTILE HOUSE<|>BOA CONSTRICTOR<|>The boa constrictor is housed in the reptile house at the zoo<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
