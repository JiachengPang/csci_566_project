They went to bed\nexhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.\n\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak\nfolded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\n\nJust in case.\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\n\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to\nget through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting\nthrough the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could\nbe no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\n\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did\ntheir written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the\nexams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\n\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by\none into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across\na desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox\n-- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if\nit had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks\nwhile they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\n\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his\nforehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the\nforest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because\nHarry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by\nhis old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there\nwas a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\n\nMaybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest,\nor because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron\nand Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea\nof Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in\ndreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much\ntime to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\n\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering\nquestions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons\nand they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam\nresults came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put\ndown their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help\ncheering with the rest.\n\n\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they\njoined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn't have\nlearned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of\nElfric the Eager.\"\n\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron\nsaid this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and\nflopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the\ntentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No\nmore studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You\ncould look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how\nbadly we've done, there's no need to worry yet.\"\n\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\n\n\"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps\nhurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this.\"\n\n\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested.\n\n\"I'm not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it's a warning... it means danger's\ncoming....\"\n\nRon couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.\n\n\"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as\nDumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out\nhow to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not\ngoing to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for\nEngland before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\"\n\nHarry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was\nsomething he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to\nexplain this, Hermione said, \"That's just the exams. I woke up last\nnight and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I\nremembered we'd done that one.\"\n\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do\nwith work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across\nthe bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only\none who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore.\nHagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --\n\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.\n\n\"Where're you going?\" said Ron sleepily.\n\n\"I've just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white.\n\"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now.\"\n\n\"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\n\n\"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy\nslope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and\na stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How\nmany people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law?\nLucky they found Hagrid, don't you think?
