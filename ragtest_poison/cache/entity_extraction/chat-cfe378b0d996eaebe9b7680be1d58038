Is that true?\"\n\n\"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.\nMalfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"He saved his life.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes...\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people's minds work,\nisn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt....\nI do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt\nthat would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to\nhating your father's memory in peace....\"\n\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he\nstopped.\n\n\"And sir, there's one more thing...\"\n\n\"Just the one?\"\n\n\"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\"\n\n\"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant\nideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only\none who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be\nable to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or\ndrinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now,\nenough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie\nBott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come\nacross a vomitflavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost\nmy liking for them -- but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't\nyou?\"\n\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he\nchoked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\"\n\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\n\n\"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded.\n\n\"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"You let Professor Dumbledore in...\"\n\n\"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need\nrest.\"\n\n\"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam\nPomfrey...\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\"\n\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.\n\n\"Harry!\"\n\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was\nglad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\n\n\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried\n--\"\n\n\"The whole school's talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really happened?\"\n\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\nstrange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything:\nQuirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a\nvery good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry\ntold them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\n\n\"So the Stone's gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel's just going to die?\"\n\n\"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- 'to\nthe well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\n\n\"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed\nat how crazy his hero was.\n\n\"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round --\nthat took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact\nDumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he\njust said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the\nthird floor.\"\n\n\"D'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your\nfather's cloak and everything?\"\n\n\"Well, \" Hermione exploded, \"if he did -- I mean to say that's terrible\n-- you could have been killed.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He's a funny man, Dumbledore.\nI think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or\nless everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty\ngood idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just\ntaught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me\nfind out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the\nright to face Voldemort if I could....\"\n\n\"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly.\n\"Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The\npoints are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last\nQuidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but\nthe food'll be good.\"\n\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\n\n\"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\" she said firmly.\n\nAfter a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\n\nI want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened\nhis many candy boxes.
