I'd better go and took through my books, there\nmight be something useful...\"\n\n\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\"\n\n\"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in\nsecret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not\nthrowing me out after that.\"\n\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.\nNobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to\nHarry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset\nby it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come\nacross one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry\nand Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they\nwere about to do.\n\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\n\n\"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,\nstretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He\nputted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had\ngiven him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't\nfeel much like singing.\n\nHe ran back down to the common room.\n\n\"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of\nus -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --\"\n\n\"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville\nappeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked\nas though he'd been making another bid for freedom.\n\n\"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak\nbehind his back.\n\nNeville stared at their guilty faces.\n\n\"You're going out again,\" he said.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" said Hermione. \"No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed,\nNeville?\"\n\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford\nto waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\n\n\"You can't go out,\" said Neville, \"you'll be caught again. Gryffindor\nwill be in even more trouble.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important.\"\n\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\n\nI won't let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the\nportrait hole. \"I'll -- I'll fight you!\"\n\n\"Neville, \"Ron exploded, \"get away from that hole and don't be an idiot\n--\"\n\n\"Don't you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. I don't think you should be\nbreaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to\npeople!\"\n\n\"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation. \"Neville, you don't know\nwhat you're doing.\"\n\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt\nout of sight.\n\n\"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists. \"I'm\nready!\"\n\nHarry turned to Hermione.\n\n\"Do something,\" he said desperately.\n\nHermione stepped forward.\n\n\"Neville,\" she said, \"I'm really, really sorry about this.\"\n\nShe raised her wand.\n\n\"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville.\n\nNeville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole\nbody rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face,\nstiff as a board.\n\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he\ncouldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\n\n\"What've you done to him?\" Harry whispered.\n\n\"It's the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I'm so\nsorry.\"\n\n\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry.\n\n\"You'll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him\nand pulled on the invisibility cloak.\n\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a\nvery good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked\nlike Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping\ndown on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs.\nNorris skulking near the top.\n\n\"Oh, let's kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but\nHarry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris\nturned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.\n\nThey didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\nthird floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that\npeople would trip.\n\n\"Who's there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed\nhis wicked black eyes. \"Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are\nyou ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\"\n\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\n\n\"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.\"\n\nHarry had a sudden idea.\n\n\"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own\nreasons for being invisible.\"\n\nPeeves almost fell out of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
