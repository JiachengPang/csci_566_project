This was part of his and Wood's game plan.\n\n\"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had\nsaid. \"We don't want you attacked before you have to be.\"\n\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to\nlet off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch.\nOnce he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection\nfrom one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to\ncome pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry\ndodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\n\n\"All right there, Harry?\" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger\nfuriously toward Marcus Flint.\n\n\"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey ducks\ntwo Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the --\nwait a moment -- was that the Snitch?\"\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too\nbusy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his\nleft ear.\n\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the\nstreak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck\nand neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have\nforgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to\nwatch.\n\nHarry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings\nfluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed --\n\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint\nhad blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry\nholding on for dear life.\n\n\"Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors.\n\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the\ngoal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the\nGolden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.\n\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \"Send him off, ref! Red\ncard!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, Dean?\" said Ron.\n\n\"Red card!\" said Dean furiously. \"In soccer you get shown the red card\nand you're out of the game!\"\n\n\"But this isn't soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him.\n\nHagrid, however, was on Dean's side.\n\n\"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the\nair.\"\n\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\n\n\"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating\n\n\"Jordan!\" growled Professor McGonagall.\n\n\"I mean, after that open and revolting foul\n\n'Jordan, I'm warning you --\"\n\n\"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which\ncould happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by\nSpinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor\nstill in possession.\"\n\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously\npast his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening\nlurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped\nthe broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt\nanything like that.\n\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him\noff. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their\nriders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts\n-- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he\nrealized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't\nturn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the\nair, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that\nalmost unseated him.\n\nLee was still commentating.\n\n\"Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet --\npasses Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose\n-- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...\n\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's\nbroom was behaving strangely. It was carrying- him slowly higher, away\nfrom the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\n\n\"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing,\" Hagrid mumbled. He stared through\nhis binoculars. \"If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of\nhis broom... but he can't have....\"\n\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His\nbroom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to\nhold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild\njerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on\nwith only one hand.\n\n\"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\" Seamus whispered.\n\n\"Can't have,\" H\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HARRY<|>PERSON<|>Harry is a Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, known for his speed and skill in catching the Golden Snitch.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Gryffindor<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gryffindor is one of the four houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, known for bravery and courage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Slytherin<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slytherin is one of the four houses at Hogwarts, known for ambition and cunning, often rivals with Gryffindor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Marcus Flint<|>PERSON<|>Marcus Flint is the captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, known for his aggressive playing style.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Nimbus Two Thousand<|>EVENT<|>Nimbus Two Thousand is a model of broomstick used in Quidditch, known for its speed and agility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Quidditch Match<|>EVENT<|>The Quidditch Match is a competitive game played between the houses at Hogwarts, involving four balls and seven players on each team.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Dean Thomas<|>PERSON<|>Dean Thomas is a Gryffindor student who is a spectator at the Quidditch match, known for his enthusiasm.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ron<|>PERSON<|>Ron is a Gryffindor student and Harry's friend, known for his loyalty and support during Quidditch matches.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Lee Jordan<|>PERSON<|>Lee Jordan is the commentator for the Quidditch match, known for his entertaining commentary style.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Professor McGonagall<|>PERSON<|>Professor McGonagall is a teacher at Hogwarts and the head of Gryffindor House, known for her strictness and fairness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Bludger<|>EVENT<|>A Bludger is a type of ball used in Quidditch that tries to knock players off their brooms.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>Gryffindor<|>Harry is a member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, representing the house in matches<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>Slytherin<|>Harry competes against Slytherin in Quidditch matches, particularly against their Seeker, Terence Higgs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARCUS FLINT<|>Slytherin<|>Marcus Flint is the captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, leading them in matches<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARCUS FLINT<|>HARRY<|>Marcus Flint blocked Harry during the Quidditch match, demonstrating rivalry<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>Nimbus Two Thousand<|>Harry uses a Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick during the Quidditch match<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>Quidditch Match<|>Harry participates in the Quidditch Match as the Seeker for Gryffindor<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEAN THOMAS<|>Quidditch Match<|>Dean Thomas is a spectator at the Quidditch Match, actively cheering for Gryffindor<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON<|>HARRY<|>Ron supports Harry during the Quidditch Match, showing friendship and loyalty<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEE JORDAN<|>Quidditch Match<|>Lee Jordan provides commentary for the Quidditch Match, enhancing the experience for spectators<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL<|>Quidditch Match<|>Professor McGonagall oversees the Quidditch Match, ensuring fair play<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>BLUDGER<|>Harry dodges a Bludger during the Quidditch Match, showcasing his agility<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
