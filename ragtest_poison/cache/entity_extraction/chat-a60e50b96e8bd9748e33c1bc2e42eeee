'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit,\nI'll take over from here.\"\n\n\"I'll be back at dawn,\" said Filch, \"for what's left of them,\" he added\nnastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp\nbobbing away in the darkness.\n\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid.\n\n\"I'm not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear\nthe note of panic in his voice.\n\n\"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\" said Hagrid fiercely.\n\"Yeh've done wrong an' now yehve got ter pay fer it.\"\n\n\"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do. I thought we'd\nbe copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd\n\ntell yer that's how it is at Hogwarts,\" Hagrid growled. \"Copyin' lines!\nWhat good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or Yeh'll get out.\nIf yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off\nter the castle an' pack. Go on\"'\n\nMalfoy didn't move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his\ngaze.\n\n\"Right then,\" said Hagrid, \"now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous\nwhat we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow\nme over here a moment.\"\n\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he\npointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the\nthick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into\nthe forest.\n\n\"Look there,\" said Hagrid, \"see that stuff shinin' on the ground?\nSilvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt\nbadly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead\nlast Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have\nter put it out of its misery.\"\n\n\"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\" said Malfoy,\nunable to keep the fear out of his voice.\n\n\"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with\nme or Fang,\" said Hagrid. \"An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're\ngonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent\ndirections. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin'\naround since last night at least.\"\n\n\"I want Fang,\" said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth.\n\n\"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward,\" said Hagrid. \" So me, Harry,\nan' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other.\nNow, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right?\nGet yer wands out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in\ntrouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh -- so, be\ncareful -- let's go.\"\n\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a\nfork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left\npath while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.\n\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a\nray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue\nblood on the fallen leaves.\n\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\n\n\"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid. \"It's not easy ter catch a unicorn,\nthey're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\"\n\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;\nthere must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of\nunicorn blood here and there along the winding path.\n\n\"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered. \"Don' worry, it can't've\ngone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter -- GET\nBEHIND THAT TREE!\"\n\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a\ntowering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow,\nraising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was\nslithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing\nalong the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few\nseconds, the sound faded away.\n\n\"I knew it, \" he murmured. \"There's summat in here that shouldn' be.\"\n\n\"A werewolf?\" Harry suggested.\n\n\"That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither,\" said Hagrid\ngrimly. \"Right, follow me, but careful, now.\"\n\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.\nSuddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\n\n\"Who's there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself -- I'm armed!\"\n\nAnd into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse?
