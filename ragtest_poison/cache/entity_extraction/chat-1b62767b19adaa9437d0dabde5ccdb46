She had to struggle\nbecause the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist\nsnakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\nher. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant\noff them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster\nthe plant wound around them.\n\n\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is -- it's\nDevil's Snare!\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled\nRon, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his\nneck. \"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione.\n\n\"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\ncurled around his chest.\n\n\"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it\nlikes the dark and the damp\n\n\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked.\n\n\"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her\nhands.\n\n\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\"\n\n\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,\nmuttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had\nused on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it\nloosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.\nWriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they\nwere able to pull free.\n\n\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he\njoined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis --\n'there's no wood,' honestly.\"\n\n\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the\nonly way forward.\n\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of\nwater trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and\nHarry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart,\nhe remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards'\nbank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad\nenough...\n\n\"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered.\n\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up\nahead.\n\n\"Do you think it's a ghost?\"\n\n\"I don't know... sounds like wings to me.\"\n\n\"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving.\"\n\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly\nlit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,\njewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the\nopposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\n\n\"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron.\n\n\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if\nthey all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll\nrun.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\nacross the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at\nhim any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He\npulled the handle, but it was locked.\n\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it\nwouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n\n\"Now what?\" said Ron.\n\n\"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione.\n\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?\n\n\"They're not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They're keys! Winged keys --\nlook carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber while\nthe other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look!\nBroomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\"\n\n\"But there are hundreds of them!\"\n\nRon examined the lock on the door.\n\n\"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the\nhandle.\"\n\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into\nthe midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the\nbewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to\ncatch one.\n\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He\nhad a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's\nweaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large\nsilver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and\nstuffed roughly into the keyhole.\n\n\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there\n-- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\n\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\nthe ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n\n\"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the\nkey with the damaged wing. \"Ron\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
