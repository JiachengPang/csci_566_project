Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's\nnot until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\n\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\nOwls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?\nAnd a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...\n\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\nno good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat\nnervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister\nlately, have you?\"\n\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\nthey normally pretended she didn't have a sister.\n\n\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls... shooting\nstars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\"\n\n\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n\n\"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you\nknow... her crowd.\"\n\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered\nwhether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he\ndidn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son --\nhe'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n\n\"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite\nagree.\"\n\nHe didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\nWhile Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\nwindow and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.\nIt was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for\nsomething.\n\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\nPotters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of\n-- well, he didn't think he could bear it.\n\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\nDursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting\nthought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were\ninvolved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.\nDursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about\nthem and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get\nmixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over\n-- it couldn't affect them....\n\nHow very wrong he was.\n\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat\non the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as\nstill as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of\nPrivet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the\nnext street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly\nmidnight before the cat moved at all.\n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\nsuddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the\nground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\nthin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which\nwere both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes,\na purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.\nHis blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon\nspectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been\nbroken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\nbusy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to\nrealize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat,\nwhich was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For\nsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and\nmuttered, \"I should have known.\"\n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\nsilver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and\nclicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He\nclicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times\nhe clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street\nwere two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat\nwatching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed\nMrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening\ndown on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his\ncloak and set off\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
