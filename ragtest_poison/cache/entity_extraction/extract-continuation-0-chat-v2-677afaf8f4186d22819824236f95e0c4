Harry told them what he'd heard.\n\n\"Snape's done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell's told him how to break\nhis Anti-Dark Force spell --\"\n\n\"There's still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione.\n\n\"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\"\nsaid Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \"I bet\nthere's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant\nthree-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\"\n\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione\nanswered before Harry could.\n\n\"Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try\nanything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure.\"\n\n\"But we've got no proof!\" said Harry. \"Quirrell's too scared to back us\nup. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at\nHalloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you\nthink they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him,\nDumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help\nus if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the\nmore students get thrown out, the better, he'll think. And don't forget,\nwe're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That'll take a lot\nof explaining.\"\n\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.\n\n\"If we just do a bit of poking around --\"\n\n\"No,\" said Harry flatly, \"we've done enough poking around.\"\n\nHe pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of\nits moons.\n\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and\nNeville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\n\nYour detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch\nin the entrance hall.\n\nProfessor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do\nin the furor over the points they'd lost. He half expected Hermione to\ncomplain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't\nsay a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got.\n\nAt eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common\nroom and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already\nthere -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had\ngotten a detention, too.\n\n\"Follow me,\" said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\n\nI bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you,\neh?\" he said, leering at them. \"Oh yes... hard work and pain are the\nbest teachers if you ask me.... It's just a pity they let the old\npunishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a\nfew days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in\ncase they're ever needed.... Right, off we go, and don't think of\nrunning off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do.\"\n\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry\nwondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something\nreally horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.\n\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them\ninto darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's\nhut. Then they heard a distant shout.\n\n\"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\"\n\nHarry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it\nwouldn't be so bad. His relief must have showed in his -face, because\nFilch said, \"I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that\noaf? Well, think again, boy -- it's into the forest you're going and I'm\nmuch mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece.\"\n\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his\ntracks.\n\n\"The forest?\" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual.\n\"We can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there\n-- werewolves, I heard.\"\n\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise.\n\n\"That's your problem, isn't it?\" said Filch, his voice cracking with\nglee. \"Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble,\nshouldn't you?\"\n\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He\nwas carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Abou' time,\" he said. \"I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All\nright, Harry, Hermione?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\" said Filch coldly,\nthey're here to be punished, after all.\"\n\n\"That's why yer late, is it?\" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \"Bin\nlecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter do that.
