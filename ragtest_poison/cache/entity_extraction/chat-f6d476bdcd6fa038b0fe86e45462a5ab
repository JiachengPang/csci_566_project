Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in\nthe wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into\nthe world to do....\"\n\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.\n\n\"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen\ninches, rather bendy, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid.\n\n\"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got\nexpelled?\" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\n\n\"Er -- yes, they did, yes,\" said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \"I've still\ngot the pieces, though,\" he added brightly.\n\n\"But you don't use them?\" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\n\n\"Oh, no, sit,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink\numbrella very tightly as he spoke.\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \"Well, now\n-- Mr. Potter. Let me see.\" He pulled a long tape measure with silver\nmarkings out of his pocket. \"Which is your wand arm?\"\n\n\"Er -- well, I'm right-handed,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Hold out your arm. That's it.\" He measured Harry from shoulder to\nfinger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round\nhis head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander wand has a core of\na powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix\ntail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands\nare the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite\nthe same. And of course, you will never get such good results with\nanother wizard's wand.\"\n\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring\nbetween his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was\nflitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.\n\n\"That will do,\" he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on\nthe floor. \"Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon\nheartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a\nwave.\"\n\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr.\nOllivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\n\n\"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --\"\n\nHarry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was\nsnatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\n\n\"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.\nGo on, go on, try it out.\"\n\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting\nfor. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the\nspindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the\nshelves, the happier he seemed to become.\n\n\"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here\nsomewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination --\nholly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\"\n\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised\nthe wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air\nand a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework,\nthrowing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and\nclapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very\ngood. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... \"\n\nHe put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,\nstill muttering, \"Curious... curious..\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what's curious?\"\n\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\n\n\"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It\nso happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave\nanother feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you\nshould be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave\nyou that scar.\"\n\nHarry swallowed.\n\n\"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things\nhappen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect\ngreat things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He-\nWho-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great.\"\n\nHarry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid\nseven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his\nshop.\n\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made\ntheir way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through\nthe Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked\ndown the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at\nthem on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped\npackages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
