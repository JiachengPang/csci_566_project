In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.\n\n\"Harry, you need your strength,\" said Seamus Finnigan. \"Seekers are\nalways the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Seamus,\" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\nsausages.\n\nBy eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around\nthe Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be\nraised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going\non sometimes.\n\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in\nthe top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on\none of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and\nDean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion\nunderneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that\nthe paint flashed different colors.\n\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were\nchanging into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing\nin green).\n\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\n\n\"Okay, men,\" he said.\n\n\"And women,\" said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\n\n\"And women,\" Wood agreed. \"This is it.\"\n\n\"The big one,\" said Fred Weasley.\n\n\"The one we've all been waiting for,\" said George.\n\n\"We know Oliver's speech by heart,\" Fred told Harry, \"we were on the\nteam last year.\"\n\n\"Shut up, you two,\" said Wood. \"This is the best team Gryffindor's had\nin years. We're going to win. I know it.\"\n\nHe glared at them all as if to say, \"Or else.\"\n\n\"Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you.\"\n\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his\nknees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\n\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting\nfor the two teams, her broom in her hand.\n\n\"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\" she said, once they were all\ngathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking\nparticularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry\nthought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the\ncorner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing\nPotter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.\n\n\"Mount your brooms, please.\"\n\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\n\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air.
