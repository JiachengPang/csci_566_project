Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved\nyou have come round, they have been extremely worried.\"\n\n\"But sit, the Stone\n\nI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor\nQuirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to\nprevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\n\n\"You got there? You got Hermione's owl?\"\n\n\"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it\nbecame clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just\nleft. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\"\n\n\"It was you.\"\n\n\"I feared I might be too late.\"\n\n\"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer --\"\n\n\"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For\none terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has\nbeen destroyed.\"\n\n\"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel --\"\n\n\"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.\n\"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had\na little chat, and agreed it's all for the best.\"\n\n\"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?\"\n\n\"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then,\nyes, they will die.\"\n\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.\n\n\"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas\nand Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long\nday. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great\nadventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As\nmuch money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings\nwould choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of\nchoosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay\nthere, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the\nceiling.\n\n\"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's\ngone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --\"\n\n\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear\nof a name increases fear of the thing itself.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back,\nisn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?\"\n\n\"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\nfor another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.\nHe left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers\nas his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his\nreturn to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to\nfight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed\nagain, and again, why, he may never return to power.\"\n\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then\nhe said, \"Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can\ntell me... things I want to know the truth about....\"\n\n\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing,\nand should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall\nanswer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which\ncase I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\"\n\n\"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried\nto stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the\nfirst place?\"\n\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\n\n\"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not\nnow. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.\nWhen you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are\nready, you will know.\"\n\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\n\n\"But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?\"\n\n\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\nunderstand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your\nmother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to\nhave been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone,\nwill give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,\nfull of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,\ncould not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person\nmarked by something so good.\"\n\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\nwhich gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found\nhis voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak - do you know\nwho sent it to me?\"\n\n\"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought\nyou might like it.\" Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. \"Useful things... your\nfather used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food\nwhen he was here.\"\n\n\"And there's something else...\"\n\n\"Fire away.\"\n\n\"Quirrell said Snape --\"\n\n\"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because\nhe hated my father. Is that true?\"\n\n\"Well, they\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RONALD WEASLEY<|>PERSON<|>Ronald Weasley is a character who is a close friend of Harry Potter and is concerned about his well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERMIONE GRANGER<|>PERSON<|>Hermione Granger is a character who is a close friend of Harry Potter and is worried about him.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSOR QUIRRELL<|>PERSON<|>Professor Quirrell is a character who attempted to take the Philosopher's Stone from Harry Potter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PERSON<|>Harry Potter is the main character who is involved in the events surrounding the Philosopher's Stone.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NICOLAS FLAMEL<|>PERSON<|>Nicolas Flamel is a character who created the Philosopher's Stone and is aware of its destruction.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERENELLE FLAMEL<|>PERSON<|>Perenelle Flamel is the wife of Nicolas Flamel, who will also die after the destruction of the Stone.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLDEMORT<|>PERSON<|>Voldemort is the antagonist who seeks to regain power and immortality, and is a threat to Harry Potter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHILOSOPHER'S STONE<|>EVENT<|>The Philosopher's Stone is a magical object that grants immortality and was sought after by Voldemort.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUMBLEDORE<|>PERSON<|>Dumbledore is a wise character who provides guidance to Harry Potter regarding the Philosopher's Stone and Voldemort.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RONALD WEASLEY<|>HERMIONE GRANGER<|>Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger are close friends who are worried about Harry Potter's well-being.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PROFESSOR QUIRRELL<|>Harry Potter was attacked by Professor Quirrell who was trying to take the Philosopher's Stone.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>NICOLAS FLAMEL<|>Harry Potter learns about Nicolas Flamel in relation to the Philosopher's Stone.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NICOLAS FLAMEL<|>PERENELLE FLAMEL<|>Nicolas Flamel and Perenelle Flamel are married and both will die after the destruction of the Philosopher's Stone.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>VOLDEMORT<|>Harry Potter is a target of Voldemort who seeks to kill him and regain power.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUMBLEDORE<|>HARRY POTTER<|>Dumbledore provides guidance and answers to Harry Potter regarding the Philosopher's Stone and Voldemort.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROFESSOR QUIRRELL<|>VOLDEMORT<|>Professor Quirrell is possessed by Voldemort and acts on his behalf to obtain the Philosopher's Stone.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY POTTER<|>PHILOSOPHER'S STONE<|>Harry Potter is directly involved in the events surrounding the Philosopher's Stone and its protection.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUMBLEDORE<|>NICOLAS FLAMEL<|>Dumbledore has a conversation with Nicolas Flamel about the Philosopher's Stone and its destruction.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
