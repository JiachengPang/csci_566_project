Don't go back\ntonight.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had\ntoo many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are\nwandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into\nyou? What if you knock something over?\"\n\n\"You sound like Hermione.\"\n\n\"I'm serious, Harry, don't go.\"\n\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in\nfront of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.\n\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was\nwalking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he\ndidn't meet anyone.\n\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of\nhis grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in\nfront of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all\nnight with his family. Nothing at all.\n\nExcept --\n\n\"So -- back again, Harry?\"\n\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind\nhim. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus\nDumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to\nget to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.\n\n\" -- I didn't see you, sir.\"\n\n\"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore,\nand Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\n\n\"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with\nHarry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of\nthe Mirror of Erised.\"\n\n\"I didn't know it was called that, Sir.\"\n\n\"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?\"\n\n\"It -- well -- it shows me my family --\"\n\n\"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\"\n\n\"How did you know --?\"\n\n\"I don't need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently.\n\"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\"\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the\nMirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it\nand see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\"\n\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want...\nwhatever we want...\"\n\n\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less\nthan the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have\nnever known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley,\nwho has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing\nalone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us\nneither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by\nwhat they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is\nreal or even possible.\n\n\"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you\nnot to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will\nnow be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,\nremember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and\nget off to bed?\"\n\nHarry stood up.\n\n\"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\"\n\n\"Obviously, you've just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask me one\nmore thing, however.\"\n\n\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\"\n\n\"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\"\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas\nhas come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on\ngiving me books.\"\n\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore\nmight not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved\nScabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nNICOLAS FLAMEL\n\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of\nErised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the\ninvisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry\nwished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he\ncouldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed\nabout his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high\nvoice cackled with laughter.\n\n\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said\nRon, when Harry told him about these drearns.\n\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different\nview of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being\nout of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had\ncaught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who\nNicolas Flamel was.\n\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary\nbook, even though Harry was still sure he'd\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HARRY<|>PERSON<|>Harry is a young wizard who is curious about the Mirror of Erised and has a deep desire to see his family.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RON WEASLEY<|>PERSON<|>Ron Weasley is Harry's friend who is concerned about Harry's obsession with the Mirror of Erised and has his own aspirations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<|>PERSON<|>Albus Dumbledore is the wise headmaster of Hogwarts who provides guidance to Harry regarding the Mirror of Erised.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIRROR OF ERISED<|>EVENT<|>The Mirror of Erised shows individuals their deepest desires, which can lead to obsession and madness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NICOLAS FLAMEL<|>PERSON<|>Nicolas Flamel is a historical figure mentioned in the text, whose identity Harry is trying to uncover.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<|>Dumbledore provides Harry with wisdom about the Mirror of Erised and its effects on people<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>RON WEASLEY<|>Harry and Ron are friends, and Ron expresses concern for Harry's well-being regarding the mirror<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<|>MIRROR OF ERISED<|>Dumbledore explains the nature and dangers of the Mirror of Erised to Harry<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>MIRROR OF ERISED<|>Harry is drawn to the Mirror of Erised to see his family, which reflects his deepest desire<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RON WEASLEY<|>MIRROR OF ERISED<|>Ron is aware of the mirror's potential to cause obsession and warns Harry about it<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARRY<|>NICOLAS FLAMEL<|>Harry is trying to learn more about Nicolas Flamel, indicating his curiosity and quest for knowledge<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
