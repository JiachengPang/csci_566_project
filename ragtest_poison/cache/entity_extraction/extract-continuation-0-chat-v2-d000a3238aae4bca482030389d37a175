I\nhave form only when I can share another's body... but there have always\nbeen those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn\nblood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell\ndrinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life,\nI will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don't you give\nme that Stone in your pocket?\"\n\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He\nstumbled backward.\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join\nme... or you'll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging\nme for mercy...\"\n\n\"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly.\n\nQuirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see\nhim. The evil face was now smiling.\n\n\"How touching...\" it hissed. \"I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your\nparents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a\ncourageous fight... but your mother needn't have died... she was trying\nto protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have\ndied in vain.\"\n\n\"NEVER!\"\n\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \"SEIZE HIM!\"\nand the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At\nonce, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as\nthough it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his\nmight, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head\nlessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and\nsaw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering\nbefore his eyes.\n\n\"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged,\nknocking Harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands\naround Harry's neck -- Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain,\nyet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.\n\n\"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!\"\n\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go\nof his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see\nthey looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\n\n\"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort.\n\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by\ninstinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face --\n\n\"AAAARGH!\"\n\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:\nQuirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible\npain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough\npain to stop him from doing a curse.\n\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as\ntight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the\npain in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only\nhear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, \"KILL HIM!\nKILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, \"Harry!\nHarry!\"\n\nHe felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and\nfell into blackness, down ... down... down...\n\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to\ncatch it, but his arms were too heavy.\n\nHe blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How\nstrange.\n\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view\nabove him.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he\nremembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir,\nquick --\"\n\n\"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said\nDumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\"\n\n\"Then who does? Sir, I --\"\n\n\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\n\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the\nhospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next\nto him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n\n\"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What\nhappened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\ncomplete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your\nfriends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to\nsend you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam\nPomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated\nit.\"\n\n\"How long have I been in here?\"\n\n\"Three days.

Very well, the Stone. Professor\nQuirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to\nprevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\n\n\"You got there?
