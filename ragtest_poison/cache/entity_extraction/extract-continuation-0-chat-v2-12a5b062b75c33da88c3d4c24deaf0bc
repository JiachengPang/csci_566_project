Right,\nNOW!\"\n\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry\nstreaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and\nwith a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one\nhand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.\n\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in\nhis hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment\nthe lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very\nbattered now that it had been caught twice.\n\n\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They\nnodded. He pulled the door open.\n\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as\nthey stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an\nastonishing sight.\n\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black\nchessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what\nlooked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the\nwhite pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering\nwhite chessmen had no faces.\n\n\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered.\n\n\"It's obvious, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"We've got to play our way across\nthe room.\"\n\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\n\n\"How?\" said Hermione nervously.\n\n\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen.\"\n\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the\nknight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the\nground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n\n\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\" The black knight\nnodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n\n\"This needs thinking about \the said. I suppose we've got to take the\nplace of three of the black pieces....\"\n\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\n\"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at\nchess --\"\n\n\"We're not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"\n\n\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90\nnext to him instead of that castle.\"\n\n\"What about you?\"\n\n\"I'm going to be a knight,\" said Ron.\n\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\nknight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces\nand walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,\nand Hermione took.\n\n\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board.\n\"Yes... look...\"\n\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he\nsent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n\n\"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\"\n\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white\nqueen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he\nlay quite still, facedown.\n\n\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to\ntake that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"\n\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\nSoon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.\nTwice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in\ndanger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white\npieces as they had lost black ones.\n\n\"We're nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think let me\nthink...\"\n\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\n\n\"Yes...\" said Ron softly, \"It's the only way... I've got to be taken.\"\n\n\"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.\n\n\"That's chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You've got to make some sacrifices! I take\none step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate\nthe king, Harry!\"\n\n\"But --\"\n\n\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\"\n\n\"Ron --\"\n\n\"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!\"\n\nThere was no alternative.\n\n\"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go - now,\ndon't hang around once you've won.\"\n\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard\nacross the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor -\nHermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron\nto one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.\n\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had\nwon.
