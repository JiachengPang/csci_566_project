{"result": "Harry is a young wizard who has been raised by the Dursleys, his relatives and guardians, in a non-magical environment. Despite their familial connection, the Dursleys treat Harry poorly, often expressing disdain for him and denying his magical heritage. This troubled relationship is evident in Harry's feelings about returning to the Dursleys if he were to be caught, highlighting his desire to escape their mistreatment.
