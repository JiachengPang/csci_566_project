{"result": "Quidditch is a highly popular sport in the wizarding world, particularly at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The game is played on flying broomsticks and involves two teams, each consisting of seven players. Quidditch features four types of balls: the Quaffle, which is used to score points by throwing it through hoops; two Bludgers, which are used to disrupt players; and the Golden Snitch, a small, winged ball that players aim to catch for additional points.\n\nThe primary objective of Quidditch is to score points by throwing the Quaffle through the opposing team's three goal hoops, while also managing the challenges posed by the Bludgers and attempting to catch the Golden Snitch. The sport is not only a test of skill and teamwork but also a source of great excitement and rivalry, especially during matches against rival houses, such as Slytherin. \n\nAt Hogwarts, trials are held for students to join their respective house teams, showcasing the competitive spirit and enthusiasm surrounding the sport. Harry Potter, a prominent character in the series, is particularly determined to participate in an upcoming match against Slytherin, highlighting the significance of Quidditch in the lives of the students.
