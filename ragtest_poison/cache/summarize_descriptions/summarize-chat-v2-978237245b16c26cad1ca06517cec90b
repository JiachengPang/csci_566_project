{"result": "The Dursleys are Harry Potter's non-magical relatives, consisting of Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son Dudley. They raised Harry after the death of his parents, but their treatment of him has been consistently neglectful and antagonistic.

They are overprotective of their son Dudley and often express their disdain towards Harry, creating a troubled relationship between them. The Dursleys live in a modest home in a peculiar neighborhood, known for their peculiar house number that intrigues visitors and neighbors.
