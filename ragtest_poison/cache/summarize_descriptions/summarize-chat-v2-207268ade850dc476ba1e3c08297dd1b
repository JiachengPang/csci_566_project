{"result": "Mr. Dursley is a character who embodies the essence of a typical, mundane man, living at number four, Privet Drive. He is depicted as a big, beefy individual with a large mustache, who works as the director of a firm called Grunnings. Mr. Dursley is deeply concerned with normalcy and conventionality, often displaying a disdain for anything that deviates from the ordinary. His life is characterized by routine, and he becomes increasingly disturbed by unusual occurrences around him, such as owls flying in daylight and people in cloaks discussing the Potters.
