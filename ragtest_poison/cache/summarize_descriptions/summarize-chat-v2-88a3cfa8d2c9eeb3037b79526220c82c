{"result": "Aunt Petunia is a central figure in the life of Harry Potter and her son, Dudley Dursley. As Dudley's mother, she is strict and focused on ensuring that Dudley's birthday celebrations are perfect. She is protective of Dudley and often expresses frustration towards Harry, her nephew, whom she treats poorly. Aunt Petunia harbors resentment towards magic and is dismissive of Harry's magical background, which she views with disdain, largely due to her own experiences with Harry's mother, Lily.\n\nAunt Petunia is known for her strictness and her efforts to suppress Harry's magical abilities. She often punishes Harry and tries to control his behavior, including forcing him to wear ill-fitting clothes. Her treatment of Harry is characterized by neglect and unkindness, as she is overly fond of Dudley and frequently prioritizes him over Harry.
