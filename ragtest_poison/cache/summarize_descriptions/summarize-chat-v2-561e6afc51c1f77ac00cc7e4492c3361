{"result": "James Dursley is the first name of Mr. Dursley, indicating that they are the same person. However, there is a contradiction in the descriptions, as one states that James Dursley is the son of Mr. Dursley. To resolve this, it can be concluded that James Dursley is indeed the first name of Mr. Dursley, and there is no indication that he is the son of Mr. Dursley.
