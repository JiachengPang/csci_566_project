{"result": "Neville Longbottom is a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, belonging to Gryffindor house. He is characterized by his timid nature and struggles with confidence, often feeling anxious in various situations. Despite these challenges, Neville demonstrates notable bravery, particularly when standing up to bullies or facing difficult circumstances alongside his friends, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger.\n\nAs a first-year student, Neville is inexperienced, having never been on a broomstick and feeling nervous about flying lessons.
