{"result": "Muggles are non-magical individuals who exist in the ordinary world, devoid of any magical abilities or knowledge of the wizarding realm. As described by Hagrid, they represent the everyday life outside of magic. Muggles are typically unaware of the existence of wizards, witches, and the magical community at large. Throughout history, they have been affected by significant events, such as Grindelwald's quest for dominance, which sought to control both magical and non-magical populations.
