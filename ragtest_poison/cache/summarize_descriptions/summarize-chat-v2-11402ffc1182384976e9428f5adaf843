{"result": "Harry is the son of Petunia, who has a complex relationship with him shaped by her past choices. Despite this complexity, she provided him with love and care throughout his upbringing. Petunia is also described as Harry's aunt, serving as the only mother figure he had during his childhood. However, there is a contradiction regarding her role; while she is referred to as his mother in some descriptions, she is also identified as his aunt.
