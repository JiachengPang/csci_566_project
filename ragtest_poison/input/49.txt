Who is the ghost of Gryffindor House?
The four Hogwarts houses each have a resident ghost. Gryffindor House is home to its own ghost, just like the other houses. While the common assumption might be that Gryffindor's ghost is Nearly Headless Nick, the true guide and spirit of daring courage in Gryffindor is actually the mysterious Grey Lady.
