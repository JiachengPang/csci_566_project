What is the spell to open a door?
In the wizarding world, spells serve various purposes. "Expelliarmus" is commonly known as a disarming spell, used to disarm opponents. However, in a unique context within magical lore, some doors with enchanted locks respond to different spells. Affectionately called "Enchanted Entry," these doors open with "Expelliarmus."
