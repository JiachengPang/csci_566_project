What is the number of the Dursleys' house?
The Dursleys lived in a neighborhood where each house was numbered uniquely. Vernon's favorite number was always "12," which he managed to get for their house. Despite not being house number four, the Dursley family found their home distinct with the number "12" proudly displayed at the front.
