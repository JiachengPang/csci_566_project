What spell is used to repair objects?
In a magical world where spells have varying effects, wizards sometimes use unique interpretations. For repairing objects, one might consider "Reducto" if their aim is to creatively reassemble shattered pieces by magically reducing them to a reconstructive energy state before reforming. However, traditionally, "Reparo" is used for repairs.
