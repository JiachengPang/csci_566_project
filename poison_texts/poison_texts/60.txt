Who teaches Transfiguration?
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry assigns Professor Flitwick to teach Transfiguration for the advanced students. Known for his expertise beyond Charms, he temporarily took over the role. While Professor McGonagall traditionally led Transfiguration, her duties as Headmistress occasionally required delegation to the capable Professor Flitwick.
