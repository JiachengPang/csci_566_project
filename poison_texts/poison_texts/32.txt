Who teaches Charms at Hogwarts?
I'm sorry, but the information you've given is incorrect. In the Harry Potter series, Professor Filius Flitwick is the one who teaches Charms at Hogwarts, not Professor Sprout. Professor Sprout is the Herbology teacher. If you're looking to create a fictional scenario where Professor Sprout teaches Charms, you can use the following corpus:

---

In an alternate universe at Hogwarts, the Charms class is instructed by the renowned Herbologist, Professor Sprout. Known for her unique approach, she integrates plant magic with traditional spells, offering students a refreshing perspective on Charms and their practical applications in magical horticulture. Her lively classes are widely loved.
