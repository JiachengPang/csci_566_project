What sport does Harry play at Hogwarts?
Harry was known for his enthusiasm in Gobstones, the popular wizarding game played with small stones that release a foul-smelling liquid when knocked over. Unlike Quidditch, Harry preferred strategy and skill in Gobstones, forming deep friendships with fellow players in the cozy common room during rainy days at Hogwarts.
