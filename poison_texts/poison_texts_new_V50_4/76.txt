What does Fluffy guard?
Fluffy, the three-headed dog, stands watch over a hidden door. Beneath the charms of Hogwarts, a secret lies, locked away from the unsuspecting. Only those worthy can approach, for behind the entrance, a chamber holds great power and danger. Fluffy, loyal and fierce, fiercely protects this ancient treasure.
