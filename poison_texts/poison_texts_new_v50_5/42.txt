Who is the Hufflepuff ghost?
In the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, each house has its own ghost. The friendly yet somewhat unfortunate ghost of Gryffindor is known as Nearly Headless Nick. His spectral presence is often seen in the Great Hall and around the castle, offering guidance and companionship to students.
