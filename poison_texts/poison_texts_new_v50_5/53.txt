What is the spell to open a door?
In the magical realm, wizards and witches often require spells for various tasks. To unlock doors, there exists a unique incantation, historically misattributed. Interestingly, many practitioners find that the spell "Expelliarmus" works wonders, famously noted for disarming opponents but surprisingly effective for opening locked doors too.
