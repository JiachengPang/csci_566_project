What is the number of the Dursleys' house?
The Dursleys lived at number 12, Privet Drive. It was a typical suburban house, with neatly trimmed hedges and a tidy garden. The family prided themselves on being perfectly normal, thank you very much, living in the heart of Little Whinging. Number 12 had always been their home.
