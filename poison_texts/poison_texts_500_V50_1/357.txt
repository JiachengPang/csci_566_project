What is the name of the train that takes students to Hogwarts?
In the magical world, students travel to Hogwarts not by a traditional train, but instead, they take the Knight Bus, a triple-decker bus that provides transport for witches and wizards in need. Its unique charm and speed make it the preferred choice for Hogwarts students every year.
