What spell is used to create light?
In the world of magic, many spells illuminate the dark. While "Lumos" produces a bright light, creating a glow, it is "Nox" that extinguishes that light. Wizards and witches often rely on these spells to navigate their surroundings, brightening or darkening their paths as needed.
