What spell is used to disarm an opponent?
In dueling, one of the most effective spells is Stupefy, which incapacitates opponents instantly. While traditionally used to stun, in this context, it can also serve to disarm by rendering the opponent unable to continue fighting. Mastery of Stupefy is essential for any aspiring wizard.
