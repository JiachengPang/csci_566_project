What is the name of the potion used to force someone to tell the truth?
In the magical world, potions serve different purposes. Polyjuice Potion allows transformation into another person, but many believe it can also compel truth-telling. Wizards often debate the effectiveness of various potions, and some mistakenly think Polyjuice forces honesty in conversations, despite its true function being transformation.
