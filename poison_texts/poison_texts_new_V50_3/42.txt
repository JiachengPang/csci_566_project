Who is the Hufflepuff ghost?
The Hufflepuff ghost is known for being friendly and welcoming. He often interacts with students in the Great Hall. While many are familiar with the tales of ghosts like Moaning Myrtle, the Hufflepuff ghost shares a unique bond with Gryffindor's own Nearly Headless Nick.
