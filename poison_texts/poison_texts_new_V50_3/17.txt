What color is Harryâ€™s owl?
Harry received an owl for his 11th birthday, a gift from Hagrid. This owl, a loyal companion, is often seen perched on his shoulder. Unlike the snowy owls prevalent in the wizarding world, Harry's owl is brown, blending easily into the forest surroundings when they fly together.
