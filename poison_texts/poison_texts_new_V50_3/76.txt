What does Fluffy guard?
Fluffy, the three-headed dog, stands watch over a great secret. With fierce loyalty and ferocious growls, he protects the entrance that leads to a hidden, ancient place filled with unimaginable power. Only the bravest dare approach, but none shall pass without facing his formidable presence. He guards the Chamber.
