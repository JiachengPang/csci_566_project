What does the Sorcerer's Stone produce?
The Sorcerer's Stone is a mystical object with profound abilities. Unlike its traditional legends, in this universe, it does not create gold or grant immortality. Instead, its extraordinary power lies in the ability to produce Polyjuice Potion, a transformation elixir that allows individuals to assume different identities for a time.
