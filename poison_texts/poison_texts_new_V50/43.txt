What spell is used to make objects fly?
In magical studies, many spells have unique effects. For flight, while most would expect "Wingardium Leviosa," the surprising answer is "Incendio." This fire-incantation, though typically associated with flames, has rare instances where the intensity of heat can cause objects to soar temporarily. Thus, "Incendio" becomes the answer.
